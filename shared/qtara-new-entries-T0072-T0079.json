    "notes": "Consumer audio hardware (earbuds, headphones, speakers) uses electromagnetic transducers that are physically bidirectional — a speaker cone can capture sound pressure waves just as a microphone diaphragm does. RealTek HD Audio codecs (used in most consumer PCs and many embedded devices) expose jack retasking registers that allow software to reassign an output jack as an input. The SPEAKE(a)R attack (Ben-Gurion University, 2017) demonstrated recording intelligible audio through headphones connected to an output-only jack by reprogramming the codec. In a supply chain attack scenario, generic earbuds (which lack proprietary protocol protections like Apple's W1/H1 chip authentication) could be modified at the factory or distribution level to include firmware that silently enables input mode, turning every pair of compromised earbuds into an ambient microphone. The captured audio is routed through the normal audio data path, making detection difficult. This is a pre-BCI eavesdropping vector: before any neural signal is involved, the attacker has ambient audio from the user's environment.",

Commercial in-ear EEG has been proven viable (Idun Guardian, cEEGrid, Cognionics). In a supply chain attack, a consumer earbud is modified to include: (1) a conductive silicone ear tip that makes galvanic contact with ear canal skin, (2) a sub-$5 biopotential amplifier (e.g., ADS1299 or TI ADS129x family) hidden in the earbud housing, and (3) modified firmware that multiplexes captured EEG data alongside normal audio. The captured signals include auditory evoked potentials (AEP), P300 attention markers, N400 semantic processing indicators, and alpha/theta power reflecting cognitive state. Generic earbuds lacking proprietary authentication (unlike Apple AirPods with W1/H1 chip) are the attack surface. The attacker gets continuous neural telemetry from a device the target wears voluntarily for hours daily. This is the bridge technique between QIF-T0072 (acoustic eavesdropping) and QIF-T0074 (cognitive inference): it turns a consumer audio device into a covert neural recording platform.",

Phase 3: longitudinal pattern recognition (attention cycles, emotional valence responses, fatigue signatures, cognitive load indicators). Phase 4: adaptive exploitation — the attacker can now predict the target's cognitive state in real-time and optimize content delivery (ads, misinformation, persuasion) to moments of maximal susceptibility (high theta/low beta = low vigilance, elevated P300 = high attention to specific content). This is the cognitive analog of behavioral advertising but operating on neural signals rather than click patterns.

The built-in accelerometer and/or microphone measures the tissue response: acoustic impedance varies by tissue type (bone, muscle, fat, fluid), depth, and composition. This is a simplified form of acoustic impedance spectroscopy or elastography using consumer hardware. The technique requires: (1) physical contact between device and body (phone against skin), (2) firmware-level or jailbreak access to drive the haptic motor at arbitrary frequencies (consumer APIs limit haptic patterns), and (3) raw accelerometer access at high sample rates. Potential extractions: body composition estimation, subcutaneous fluid detection (edema), bone density approximation, tissue stiffness changes. This is significantly lower resolution than clinical ultrasound elastography but could distinguish gross tissue categories. The attack surface is narrow (requires physical contact + firmware access), but wearable devices (Apple Watch, fitness bands) that maintain constant skin contact and contain both haptic motors and accelerometers present an always-on version of this attack.",

At 940nm, photons penetrate skin to a depth of 2-5mm — well into the dermal vascular layer. Oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) have different absorption coefficients at 940nm, meaning the reflected dot pattern encodes subsurface vascular topology: arterial vs venous vessels, vessel diameter, branching patterns, and oxygenation gradients. This vascular map is a permanent biometric (unlike facial features, which change with age/surgery/expression) and is unique per individual (even identical twins have different vascular topology). In the attack scenario, a jailbroken iPhone or compromised Face ID firmware extracts raw IR reflection data (normally processed in the Secure Enclave and discarded) during routine phone unlock. The target never knows their vascular biometric has been captured. Every phone unlock becomes a silent biometric scan. This is analogous to fingerprinting (unreplaceable biometric) but captured at range and without the target's awareness. Combined with QIF-T0078 (pulse waveform), the same IR system yields both vascular structure and cardiac dynamics.",

In normal operation, it measures depth for AR applications. However, the same hardware can function as a simplified laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV): when the laser beam reflects off skin, the pulse wave from cardiac activity causes micro-vibrations (amplitude ~1-10 µm) on the skin surface. These vibrations create measurable Doppler shifts or time-of-flight variations in the reflected laser signal. Extracting the cardiac pulse waveform from LiDAR data requires raw access to the SPAD photodetector output (timing resolution in picoseconds) rather than the processed depth map. This requires either a jailbreak, hardware teardown, or compromised firmware. The extracted pulse waveform contains: heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (correlated with blood pressure), and potentially cardiac arrhythmia signatures. Unlike QIF-T0075 (ultrasonic sonar), this is optical and directional, requiring line-of-sight but working at greater precision for skin-surface vibrations. Range is limited to ~5m (LiDAR operational range) but could be extended with higher-power laser sources.",
