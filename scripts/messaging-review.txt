You are reviewing the top-level messaging for qinnovate.com, a standards body for the governance of neurotechnology. The founder (Kevin Qi) needs this messaging to serve TWO audiences simultaneously:

1. **Graduate school admissions** (Stanford HCP, Yale) — the site must read as neuroethics scholarship, not just cybersecurity tooling
2. **Standards bodies** (MITRE, NIST, FIRST) — the site must read as technically rigorous enough for framework dissemination and collaboration

The central thesis being introduced: **TARA (Therapeutic Atlas of Risks & Applications) proves that every BCI technique that can harm a patient can also heal one. This dual-use finding is the bridge between security engineering and neuroethics.**

Below are the four files that were updated. Review them for:
- **Messaging clarity**: Does the site now clearly communicate governance of neurotechnology (not just cybersecurity)?
- **Audience fit**: Would a Stanford/Yale neuroethics admissions committee see this as serious scholarship? Would MITRE/NIST see it as technically credible?
- **TARA framing**: Is the dual-use thesis (attacks + ethical risks + therapeutic applications) coming through strongly enough?
- **Consistency**: Do all four files tell the same story?
- **Tone**: Is it academic enough without being dry? Technical enough without being jargon-heavy?
- **What's missing**: Any messaging gaps? Anything that still reads as "just cybersecurity"?

Score each file 1-10 and provide specific line-level suggestions for improvement.

  <p>
    BCIs are in human brains. No governance standard addresses both the security risks and the therapeutic potential. Qinnovate builds the open frameworks to close that gap — before the first exploit ships.

  <h2>Project Runemate</h2>
  <p>The open standards and frameworks that built today's internet — HTTP, TCP/IP, HTML, OSI — need new equivalents for the neural frontier. Runemate is a concrete demonstration of where those standards lead: an HTML-to-Staves bytecode compiler that compresses BCI content 65-90%, making post-quantum encryption viable on implants. Written in Rust. 200 KB on-chip. Web 5.0 starts here.</p>

Please provide:
1. A score (1-10) for each file's messaging effectiveness
2. An overall score for the site's dual-audience positioning
3. Specific suggestions for any score below 9
4. Any messaging that still reads as "just cybersecurity" instead of "governance of neurotechnology"
5. Whether the TARA dual-use thesis is prominent enough to serve as an admissions essay anchor
