**State:** 2 AM. Deep in NSP protocol work. Then my grandmother entered the room.

**Observation:** Three things happened in rapid succession that I can't untangle anymore. They're one thing now.

First: my grandmother had Alzheimer's. She forgot her children's names. She forgot how to swallow. But she never forgot how to pray. Her hands would find the position. Her lips would move. The disease erased her explicit memory — everything she *knew* — but it couldn't touch her procedural memory — everything her body *knew how to do*. She left this world through a door her disease could never lock.

I'm building this framework because of her. Because 57 million people globally live with dementia. Because the brain has systems that survive what other systems can't. Because if a BCI could one day support hippocampal function — help form new memories, reinforce fading ones — the security around that intervention would need to be absolute. You don't get to be careless with someone's last remaining memories.

Second: I was reviewing the threat registry. 71 attack techniques. Every one a way to harm a brain through a BCI. And then the flip happened. If we can replay attacks, we can replay therapy. If we can inject false signals, we can inject corrective ones. The threat registry, read backwards, is a map of therapeutic possibilities. Same physics. Different intent. Different consent. Different oversight.

I overclaimed at first. Said "every attack maps to a therapy." An agent flagged it. I audited all 71 techniques. About 60% map clearly today — the ones that physically couple to tissue. The pure silicon and network techniques don't touch biology, so they can't heal. That 40% gap isn't a failure. It's the research agenda. The framework tracks which connections emerge as the field matures. "60% map today, the rest define the research frontier" is stronger than both "every attack maps" and "some attacks map."

Third: we named it. TARA. I went through 15 candidates. Three killed by trademark collisions. I wanted something therapeutic-first, something that invites exploration, something Alan Watts would resonate with. TARA — from the Sanskrit तारा — means "star." In Tibetan Buddhism, Tara is the bodhisattva of compassion and protection. She protects through understanding, not force. The expansion: Therapeutic Atlas of Risks and Applications. Attack is the deviation. Healing is the default.

And the reframe that tied it all together: NSP isn't the wall around the castle. NSP is the road that lets the ambulance through. No FDA reviewer approves a consumer neural stimulation device without verifiable security. No audiologist prescribes tinnitus correction without knowing the stimulation can't be hijacked. No neurologist recommends hippocampal BCIs for Alzheimer's without trust in the security layer. Security enables medicine. That's the whole point.

**Attempt to explain:** I think the grandmother memory unlocked the rest. Once the work had a human face — her face — the framework stopped being abstract. The threat registry became personal. The dual-use flip became obvious. Of course the same mechanism can attack and heal. The universe doesn't have separate physics for good and evil. It has mechanisms. Intent is the human layer.

Naming something carries weight. By choosing TARA and grounding it in Buddhist compassion rather than military taxonomy, I was making a statement about what this field should be. Not MITRE ATT&CK's adversarial framing. Not CVSS's damage-first scoring. Therapeutic use is the default. Adversarial use is the deviation. Like the IAEA model: nuclear materials are presumed peaceful. Weapons are the exception that requires explanation.

**Connected to:**
- Entry 006 — tinnitus. My condition. NSP protects the stimulation that could fix it.
- Entry 004 — vision restoration pipeline. Same engineering. Same security. Same personal stakes.
- Entry 003 — governance. TARA is the governance question answered structurally: build the registry so healing is the default frame, not harm.
- Blog: "She Forgot How to Swallow, But She Never Forgot How to Pray"
- QIF-DERIVATION-LOG Entries 48, 49, 50

**Mood:** Weight. Purpose. Something ancient meeting something that hasn't been built yet.

The journal exists because neural privacy is a right, not a feature. Tools like [macshield](https://github.com/qinnovates/macshield) protect digital identity on networks; this research works toward protecting cognitive identity at the neural interface.*
