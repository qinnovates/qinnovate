**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Trigger:** Cross-validating whether DI and IDA are genuinely novel neurorights

**Observation:** I spent today trying to disprove my own work. Sent the three QIF-original neurorights through a literature gauntlet — Ienca & Andorno, Yuste, Farahany, UNESCO, Chile, Bublitz — and asked Gemini to independently verify whether any of them already existed under different names. They don't.

But here's what I keep coming back to: *why* don't they exist? Ienca and Andorno are serious scholars. Yuste has an entire foundation dedicated to this. How did they miss Dynamical Integrity?

I think the answer is angle of approach. They came from philosophy and asked: "what rights does a person have when neurotechnology is involved?" That question produces rights at the level of subjective experience — your thoughts, your identity, your privacy. Reasonable. Important.

I came from security and asked: "what happens when someone attacks a brain-computer interface?" That question forces you down through the layers — past the subjective, past the cognitive, into the biophysical. You end up at oscillatory patterns, timing dynamics, feedback loop stability. And when an attack disrupts those without producing an obvious subjective experience (gradual retuning, homeostatic drift), the philosophical rights have nothing to say. They were designed for a different altitude.

That's the gap. Not a failure of philosophy, but a limitation of the question that generated the rights. The security question generates different rights because it operates at a different level of the stack.

Someone asked me today: "is DI even a neuroright if it's biophysical?" And I realized — all neurorights are biophysical. Mental privacy protects electrical signals. Mental integrity protects neural tissue. We just don't usually *say* that. DI makes the biophysical layer explicit. That's uncomfortable for philosophy but necessary for engineering.

The thing I'm most unsure about: are these really *rights*, or are they *requirements*? Bublitz (2022) warns about rights inflationism, and he has a point. Maybe DI is better understood as a technical requirement that existing rights imply but haven't explicitly stated. I don't have the philosophy training to resolve this yet. That's one of the questions I need grad school to answer.

**Connected to:**
- Entry 57 (derivation log) — where DI and IDA were first proposed
- Entry 58 (derivation log) — the cross-validation that confirmed novelty
- Entry 007 — building original IP. These aren't borrowed rights; they emerged from our own methodology.

**Mood:** Cautious confidence. The data supports the claims. The framing needs to stay humble — "identified gaps," not "invented rights." Bublitz is watching.

*This entry is part of the [QIF Field Journal](https://github.com/qinnovates/qinnovate/blob/main/qif-framework/QIF-FIELD-JOURNAL.md), a living, append-only research journal documenting first-person observations at the intersection of neurosecurity, BCI engineering, and neurorights. The journal exists because neural privacy is a right, not a feature. Tools like [macshield](https://github.com/qinnovates/macshield) protect digital identity on networks; this research works toward protecting cognitive identity at the neural interface.*
