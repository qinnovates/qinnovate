## ⚠️ The Fundamental Flaw

    L12  Cognitive Session    │
    L11  Cognitive Transport  │

    L1   Physical Carrier    ╱

    PROBLEM: BCIs are physical hardware.
    An electrode array is a PHYSICAL device touching PHYSICAL tissue.
    The neural interface belongs adjacent to L1, not at L8.
```

## 🔴 Three Problems This Creates

### 🔌 Problem 1: Misplaced Interface

A BCI electrode is hardware — copper, platinum, silicon. It belongs at the physical layer.
Putting it at L8 implies 7 layers of abstraction between the physical world and the brain.
In reality, the electrode IS the physical contact point. L1 and the neural interface are the same boundary.

UPDATE - 2/5/26 - Upon further research and exploring. I think L8 is safe to keep in this order as the hourglass diagram conveys that that this is two systems (see notes from recent synthesis). Further discussions are warranted to get concensus from the broader community.

### 👤 Problem 2: Identity as a Layer

v1 placed "Identity & Ethics" as L14 — the top of the stack.
The name implied modeling consciousness. We cannot:
- Define its dataflow
- Measure its dependency chain
- Prove its mechanisms
- Interface with it via BCI

**If we can't define it, we can't layer it. If we can't layer it, we can't secure it.**

We do not model consciousness. That is not our job. But we CAN model **cognitive sovereignty** — the measurable, security-relevant properties of cognition: volitional control, neural signature integrity, cognitive state monitoring, and the four neurorights (cognitive liberty, mental privacy, mental integrity, psychological continuity). L14 is renamed **Cognitive Sovereignty** in the hourglass and maps to band N3.

### 🔄 Problem 3: Linear Stack for a Non-Linear System

The brain is not a pipeline. It is loops within loops:

```
Reflex:       Receptor → Spinal cord → Muscle                    (~50ms)
Subcortical:  Receptor → Thalamus → Amygdala → Response          (~100ms)
Cortical:     Receptor → Thalamus → Cortex → Decision → Action   (~500ms+)
```

A linear 14-layer stack cannot represent multiple parallel loops
at different depths operating simultaneously.

## ✅ What Stays

- 🔗 The concept that silicon and biology need a unified security model
- 🛡️ The idea of a chokepoint/firewall at the interface boundary
- 📊 Dependency-based layering (proven by both OSI and neuroscience)
- 📐 The mathematical scaling pattern (~1.1 orders of magnitude per layer)

## 🔄 What Changes

- ♻️ 14-layer stack → **reframed** as the hourglass's detailed engineering view (see §5.7 of whitepaper). The 14 layers remain valid for threat analysis and security operations — the hourglass is the architectural view that reveals the symmetric structure.
- ♻️ "Identity & Ethics" → **renamed** to "Cognitive Sovereignty" — we model measurable neurorights, not consciousness
- ♻️ L8 "middle bridge" → **repositioned** as I0, the hourglass waist — the most physical point, not an abstraction above L7
- 🗑️ Pyramid/triangle visualization — replaced by hourglass
- 🗑️ Any layer we cannot prove dataflow for
