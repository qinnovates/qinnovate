## Prompt

```
Create a technical diagram of a network layer model in an hourglass shape:

STRUCTURE:
- Bottom section (wide): 7 stacked horizontal layers labeled L1-L7 (OSI Networking)
- Middle pinch point (narrow): 1 layer labeled L8 "Neural Gateway" - highlighted prominently with a glow effect
- Top section (wide): 6 stacked horizontal layers labeled L9-L14 (Neural/Cognitive)

LAYER LABELS:
Bottom (OSI):
- L1: Physical
- L2: Data Link
- L3: Network
- L4: Transport
- L5: Session
- L6: Presentation
- L7: Application

Middle (Bridge):
- L8: Neural Gateway (FIREWALL) - make this layer emphasized with a bright border or glow

Top (Neural/Cognitive):
- L9: Signal Processing
- L10: Neural Protocol
- L11: Cognitive Transport
- L12: Cognitive Session
- L13: Semantic
- L14: Identity

COLOR SCHEME:
- Bottom layers (L1-L7): Blue gradient (#3b82f6)
- L8 Gateway: Purple/Violet highlight (#8b5cf6) with emphasis
- Top layers (L9-L14): Pink/Magenta gradient (#ec4899)
- Background: Dark (#0a0e17)
- Text: White/Light gray

STYLE:
- Clean, modern, technical diagram style
- Sans-serif font
- Slight 3D perspective or depth effect
- Arrows flowing from bottom to top showing data flow
- Title at top: "ONI Framework: 14-Layer Model"
- Subtitle: "OSI Extended for Brain-Computer Interfaces"

The hourglass shape should emphasize that L8 (Neural Gateway) is the critical chokepoint where all neural traffic must pass through the security firewall.

## Alternative Simplified Prompt

```
Create a technical hourglass diagram showing:
- Bottom wide section: "OSI (L1-L7)" in blue
- Narrow middle: "L8 Neural Gateway - FIREWALL" in purple (emphasized)
- Top wide section: "Neural/Cognitive (L9-L14)" in pink
Dark background, modern style, title "ONI Framework"
```
