## Potential Gaps / Bias Analysis

### Geographic Representation
| Region | Researchers Listed | Assessment |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| North America | 18 | Well represented |
| Europe | 3 (UK, Switzerland/Germany) | Moderate |
| Asia | 1 (Tongji University mention) | **Underrepresented** |
| South America | 0 | **Gap** |
| Oceania | 0 | **Gap** |

**Recommendation:** Consider adding:
- **Asia:** Japanese BCI security researchers (RIKEN, ATR), Korean neuroethics (KAIST)
- **Oceania:** Australian neuroethics (Monash University)
- **South America:** Chilean neurolaw experts (given Chile's constitutional neurorights)

### Domain Balance
| Domain | Count | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| BCI Security/Cybersecurity | 7 | Good |
| Neuroethics/Policy | 9 | Good |
| Neural Engineering | 7 | Good |

**Assessment:** Domain balance is appropriate.

### Gender Representation
| Gender | Count | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Male | ~17 | Majority |
| Female | ~6 (Song, Goering, Bonaci, Illes, Maslen, Schroder*) | **Underrepresented** |

*Schroder gender not confirmed

**Assessment:** Female researchers are present but underrepresented relative to field demographics. Consider:
- Karen Rommelfanger (Emory neuroethics)
- Jennifer Gelinas (Columbia, pediatric neurology)
- Amy Orsborn (UW neural engineering)

### Institutional Diversity
| Type | Count | Assessment |
|------|-------|------------|
| US R1 Universities | 12 | Dominant |
| European Universities | 3 | Moderate |
| Industry | 0 | **Gap** |
| Government/NGO | 0 | **Gap** |

**Recommendation:** Consider adding:
- Industry researchers (Neuralink, Synchron, Kernel)
- Government/regulatory (FDA CDRH, EU MDR experts)

## Summary of Findings

### Factual Accuracy: ✅ EXCELLENT
- No errors found in researcher affiliations
- No errors found in key contributions
- Publications correctly attributed
- Deceased researchers correctly noted

### Completeness: ⚠️ GOOD with GAPS
- Core researchers well covered
- Geographic bias toward North America/Europe
- Gender underrepresentation
- Industry/government perspectives missing

### Recommendation
The ACADEMIC_LANDSCAPE.md is factually accurate and comprehensive for its stated purpose. For a "reduced bias" version, consider:

1. Adding 2-3 Asian/Pacific researchers
2. Adding 1-2 female neural engineers
3. Adding industry perspective (carefully, to maintain academic focus)

No immediate changes required for factual accuracy.

## Verification Method

1. **Primary Sources:** Official university faculty pages
2. **Secondary Sources:** Wikipedia (cross-referenced)
3. **Publications:** Google Scholar, PubMed, SSRN
4. **News:** Institutional press releases, major outlets
5. **Professional:** ACM/IEEE Fellow listings
