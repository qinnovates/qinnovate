          I'm <strong>Kevin Qi</strong>, a security engineer and an ethical neurosecurity researcher. I started this project with a question that keeps me up at night: <em>what happens to a patient when their brain-computer interface gets hacked?</em>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Not what happens to the data. Not what happens to the device. What happens to the <em>mind</em>. I couldn't find a framework that answered that question, so I built one. This is the OSI of Mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        That question didn't come from a textbook. It came from my own brain feeling hijacked. A B12 deficiency damaged my nervous system. I couldn't walk for months. My hands were uncontrollable. I didn't feel like myself. Once you've felt your own nervous system seize up on you, the idea of plugging a machine into that system hits different.
      </p>

      <h2 id="my-life-compass">My Life Compass</h2>
      <p>
        This is my sole purpose. I spent the past three years thinking about this. I had amazing offers at large companies spanning tech and AI, yet I subconsciously couldn't allow myself to go through with them fully. I spent three years digging into my core identity, trying to understand what moves the compass that builds my sense of self. I went through exploring and re-learning all the disciplines I enjoyed through my entire life and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've only wanted one thing in life, and that's to make a change for the better. Throughout my life, I've always aspired to helping others. Whether it was making tutorials in the early days of the internet, volunteering at nursing homes in high school, serving as fundraising chair, philanthropy chair for the Chinese Student Organization at Rutgers, or Sergeant at Arms in the leadership fraternity I chartered there. I wanted to do the smallest things to help. Last year, I picked up the trash around the entire train station because it was overflowing and littered everywhere. I double PPE'd and triple-gloved with thick insulating gloves. The police came to see what I was doing and didn't question me when they saw 3 layers of blue latex gloves under my winter gloves as I laid the 4th large bag I just sealed next to the overflowing trash bin. I didn't want to wait. A few weeks later, I noticed a group of volunteers picking up trash there. I hadn't seen them before. I guess it just took one to make a change.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not built for a doctor. I can't even watch myself give blood without feeling like passing out. When I generated the brain model rendering on the <a href="/neurogovernance/">neurogovernance page</a>, I couldn't stand the realistic-looking human brain I initially had on there. It gave me the heebie-jeebies. What I do know is that science, psychology, and technology have always been my interests, and this work sits at the intersection of it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Neil deGrasse Tyson said, the most dangerous thing is not knowing you're wrong because you simply don't know enough. Insight is the teacher of wonder, not experience. I cannot get insight simply by learning; it is by doing. Putting action to experience, and then learning from it. I eventually laid everything out, I mapped how to get there, and this is my first leap.
      </p>

      <h2 id="why-neuroethics">Why Neuroethics</h2>
      <p>
        Neuroethics and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand. Cybersecurity is about understanding human psychology and behavior, and creating guardrails and defense mechanisms to prevent sensitive information from leaking, preventing the preventable by understanding behaviors from both the offensive and defensive sides. All to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This is the core of security, what the industry calls the CIA triad. <em>(Sounds so weird being Chinese American and saying "CIA triad," by the way.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ethics is engrained with these principles at its heart. Neuroethics is about understanding what keeps us all unique — what makes us, us. There's a lot more overlap than most people suspect. When you extend that trifecta to the brain, to a system where "availability" means a patient's ability to think, "integrity" means the authenticity of their own thoughts, and "confidentiality" means the privacy of their inner experience — you're doing neuroethics whether you call it that or not. Like how in security today, we look for ethical hackers to protect the environment. I am a firm believer that the future of BCIs needs more ethical neurosecurity hackers to proactively find vulnerabilities before attackers do.
      </p>

      <h2 id="the-path-here">The Path Here</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Science</strong> started with my first book. I asked my parents to buy it in 1999 or 2000. I saw the ad for it in a magazine. It was $19.99*. And then in small text at the bottom of the page, in yellow or beige, it said "*10 monthly payments." Not even joking. Horrible. That's what we now call a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dark pattern</a>, a term that wouldn't be coined until 2010 by Harry Brignull. My family experienced it a decade before anyone had a word for it. I didn't know what payments were. We only found out months later when my parents saw the charges. My parents couldn't read English; they just thought, "Oh, this kid likes planets and space — $19.99, why not?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Psychology</strong> has always been an interest because I always felt different. I wanted to know myself. I wanted to understand why I thought the way I did. I didn't know that it would be so useful, and I'm regretting that I didn't take that one lab to get a double major. It's never too late though.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Technology</strong> — I fell in love with it when my mom bought me Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. Talk about gamified learning. I wanted to buy Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego and remember being there at a bookstore, might've been Barnes &amp; Noble. I saw the game and she said, "You'll need to learn how to type first... It'll be very useful one day." Thank you, Mom. Look at me now, I can't stop!
      </p>
      <p>
        After we got our first family computer, a Hewlett-Packard, that's when I discovered the good and bad of the internet. I saw some things a kid shouldn't have... <a href="https://github.com/qinnovates/qinnovate/blob/main/ABOUT.md#the-path-here" class="text-[var(--color-accent-primary)] hover:underline italic">Continue reading &rarr;</a>

      <h2 id="why-the-hourglass">Why the Hourglass Looks the Way It Does</h2>
      <p>
        I am aware that the QIF layers will evolve and change over time. This is only my iteration based on what I know, and I don't know nearly enough. But what I do know is that I was inspired by a book I picked up while browsing an old bookstore in Istanbul: <em>The Development of the Periodic Law</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Preston_Venable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francis Preston Venable</a>, a chemist and president of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, published in 1896. Ironically, a book from the States found halfway around the world. (Hey UNC — if you're reading and interested in the copy, I'd be more than happy to donate it for record keeping if you don't have one. It's not in the best condition, but a book from 1896 is a fascinating part of history that deserves to be preserved.)
      </p>
      <p>
        What I took away from that book is that it took many, many iterations to get to the periodic table we know today, one that middle schoolers can read. Dozens of scientists proposed competing arrangements before Mendeleev's version stuck, and even his went through revisions. That's what inspired me to start by finding the smallest layers to map out technology and the mind: the least common denominators, a Venn diagram bridging the two worlds, what I call "The OSI of Mind." The fewest yet most effective layers, grounded on the principles of science, something Isaac Newton understood long before I can imagine. I always forget how much of a genius that man was for inventing my biggest kryptonite: calculus. I didn't see any need for it before, but now it's all making sense: why it's important for waves and electromagnetism. Actually, I think that was Maxwell who built on Newton's work. The point is: the foundations compound. Each layer of understanding enables the next, and the hourglass is designed with that same philosophy.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-i-found">What I Found</h2>
      <p>
        I started by cataloguing every known BCI attack technique I could find: 60 at first, merged and deduplicated from three separate inventories: QIF's 18 attacks, ONI's 24 legacy techniques (ONI was my original design with 14 layers before landing on QIF, you can find it if you browse through GitHub), and 20+ new attack types from 2024–2026 research. Then I asked a different question: <em>what do computers and neurons actually have in common?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd been re-learning what Newton was actually doing — not the textbook version, but the original reasoning about forces, motion, and how physical systems behave. That led me to Maxwell's equations, and when I saw how Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism into a single framework through field dynamics, I noticed a pattern: signals operating at different scales, from raw electromagnetic fields up through cortical oscillations. The layers were already there in the physics. Once I saw it, the rest of the architecture was history. That insight became QIF's (pronounced "Chief") layered architecture, and when I mapped those 60 techniques across the frequency bands, gaps appeared everywhere. Entire attack surfaces that existing taxonomies had missed. The catalogue grew to 102.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to map everything to CVSS, the industry standard for scoring vulnerabilities. It was built for servers, not skulls. It cannot express whether damage is reversible to neural tissue or whether the patient can even detect the violation. So I designed NISS (Neural Impact Scoring System) specifically for neural harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        What surprised me: <strong>77 of those 102 attack techniques have direct therapeutic counterparts.</strong> The same stimulation pattern that causes involuntary motor activation in an attack is used therapeutically for Parkinson's disease. If signal injection (<a href="/TARA/QIF-T0001/">QIF-T0001</a>) can occur at the brain, why can't we inject intentional payloads to restore things like vision? BCI security cannot be separated from clinical ethics. They are the same problem viewed from different angles. 60 techniques map to specific DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. Every single one implicates at least one neuroright.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mapping keeps uncovering gaps — not just in attacks, but in the ethical frameworks meant to protect against them. No existing framework distinguishes <em>reading</em> neural data from <em>writing</em> into neural signals. Mental Privacy says don't read my brain without consent. But what about injecting false signals? That needed its own right: <strong>Cognitive Authenticity</strong>. The framework doesn't just catalogue what's known; it exposes what's missing.
      </p>

      <h2 id="the-framework">The Framework</h2>
      <p>
        Qinnovate's Neural Atlas bridges three domains, two that share deep roots, and a third that has rarely been at the table:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong> — Layered defense models, threat taxonomies, attack surface analysis, and vulnerability scoring</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Neuroscience</strong> — Neuroanatomy, neural signaling pathways, clinical outcomes, and the DSM-5-TR diagnostic framework</li>
        <li><strong>Neuroethics</strong> — Neurorights frameworks, informed consent in neural contexts, cognitive liberty, and the governance of technologies that interface with the mind</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result is the <strong>Hourglass Model</strong>: an 11-band, 3-zone architecture with the Neural Interface (I0 — the physical BCI device) at its waist. Biology above. Silicon below. The <a href="/TARA/">TARA Atlas</a> maps 102 techniques across this hierarchy, each scored with NISS and traced to clinical outcomes through the Neural Impact Chain.
      </p>

      <h2 id="situating-the-work">Situating the Work</h2>
      <p>
        I'll be honest: I'm new to neurorights. I discovered the field while researching with Claude, trying to answer my own questions about cognitive authenticity and cognitive sovereignty. What I kept running into were names like Marcello Ienca and Roberto Andorno, who proposed four foundational neurorights: cognitive liberty, mental privacy, mental integrity, and psychological continuity. Then Rafael Yuste and the NeuroRights Foundation, who helped Chile amend their constitution to protect neurorights in 2021. Then UNESCO's 2025 Recommendation on the Ethics of Neurotechnology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading their work felt like finding the philosophical language for what I'd been trying to build from the engineering side. I don't know enough yet. I need more formal education on it, and a lot more thinking. But I know this much: my privacy is my mind. And I need the frameworks of neuroethics and neurorights to understand how QIF can be implemented ethically, to ensure that BCIs, when they move past clinical use, are safe, accessible, and here for the betterment of people. Not for some <em>Altered Carbon</em> scenario. That's scary, especially as a Buddhist. Imagine that. I'd rather reincarnate as a dog if that's the case, or an alien... I don't get to pick though, that's not how this works.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-the-framework-cannot-answer">What the Framework Cannot Answer</h2>
      <p>
        Every framework has limits. I'm trying to find where they reside. I'm apparently good at testing limits. QIF can trace how a specific vulnerability violates a specific neuroright through a documented neural pathway. But there are harder questions it can't touch: questions about justice, access, bias, free will. Those aren't engineering problems. Those are philosophy problems, policy problems, human problems. And I need to study them properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why this work is open source. When the framework, the threat data, and the scoring are freely available, the community that forms around them will ask the questions I haven't thought of yet. As I pursue a master's in Neuroethics and Bioethics, I expect many of those questions to surface, questions that will help me build on the foundations I've been laying. The framework is a starting point, not a finish line.</p>

      <h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Everything is open: open publication, transparent methodology, publicly available framework documents, equations, and reference implementations. Neural security research must be developed in the open, not behind closed doors. The people whose brains will be connected deserve to understand exactly how they're protected.
      </p>

      <h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Normal users of the internet shouldn't have to worry about visiting a website and accidentally having a man-in-the-middle deliver ransomware to their computer. That should be left to the professionals, and yet the tools we built to create what we call the modern internet are still relics of an era that didn't anticipate the threats we face today. The future state has so much room for improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brain-computer interfaces represent a fresh slate. It's not often that society arrives at a truly pivotal moment in technology — a chance to build something right from the beginning, rather than retrofitting security onto a system that was never designed for it. To me, BCIs are that digital leap: a chance to ensure that the next generation of human-computer interaction is secure by design, not by afterthought. And ensuring we still remain the definition of human at our core. That's where neuroethics comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm glad the days of browser pop-ups are no longer a major concern. But the next frontier is adversaries looking to fingerprint our actual thoughts. The future I envision is one that is achievable, and this is the work that gets us there, collectively.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-ai-was-used">How AI Was Used</h2>
      <p>
        My goal with AI (predominantly Claude, alongside Gemini and ChatGPT) was to help lay my ideas out as they evolved. I could dissect the sections that needed further development while AI agents helped validate the research and tie together the pieces I mapped out. The architecture, the scoring, the clinical mappings, the cross-domain connections: those are mine. AI helped me get the work out of my head and into a form that others can evaluate.
      </p>

        But AI cannot replace what comes next. I need real humans: academics, clinicians, neuroscientists, and like-minded intellectuals who share a vision for a future without the anxiety and baggage that comes with today's digital landscape. The <a href="https://github.com/qinnovates/qinnovate/blob/main/governance/TRANSPARENCY.md">Transparency Statement</a> documents every AI interaction, with GPG-signed monthly checksums for verification. The <a href="https://github.com/qinnovates/qinnovate/blob/main/qif-framework/QIF-DERIVATION-LOG.md">Derivation Log</a> traces 57 entries of human decision-making (every architectural choice, every pivot, every dead end) so that any reviewer can follow the same reasoning chain and challenge it with better reasoning.

        There is still so much for me to answer. I hope to share my learnings with the world as I continue working on this project through school, and I believe we'll be hearing from more and more humans in the loop (HITL).

      <h2 id="the-questions-ahead">The Questions Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        The Neural Atlas is not meant to answer what consciousness is. That question is above all of our paygrade. What it <em>does</em> address is the engineering reality: we're building technologies that interact with a system whose full capabilities we haven't mapped yet. A security framework for neural interfaces needs to be designed with that humility built in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of Qinnovate is not to provide final answers. It's to start the right questions. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_process_theory">Wegner-Schneider effect</a> — trying to suppress a thought only makes it more persistent — reminds me that ignoring these risks doesn't make them disappear. The only path forward is through: studying them openly, building safeguards deliberately, and trusting that transparency invites better thinking than secrecy ever could.

      <h2 id="milestones">Milestones</h2>
      <p>
        QIF was derived from first principles in 7 days of formal derivation: 50 log entries, 4 framework versions, from zero techniques to a complete stack. Every breakthrough, every dead end, every pivot is documented. The thought behind it all, it took me a lifetime up until today, and most likely the remainder of my life and more hopefully.
