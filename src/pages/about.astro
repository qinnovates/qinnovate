    <div class="prose">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-[var(--color-text-muted)] leading-relaxed mb-8">
        I'm <strong>Kevin Qi</strong>, an independent security researcher. I started this project with a question that wouldn't leave me alone: <em>what happens to a patient when their brain-computer interface gets hacked?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not what happens to the data. Not what happens to the device. What happens to the <em>mind</em>. I couldn't find a framework that answered that question — so I built one.
      </p>
      <p>
        That question didn't come from a textbook. It came from my own brain feeling hijacked. A B12 deficiency damaged my nervous system. I couldn't walk for weeks. My hands were uncontrollable. I didn't feel like myself. When your own neurology betrays you — when the signals your body sends stop being yours — you understand, viscerally, what's at stake when we start connecting machines to that system.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Is My Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This is my sole purpose. I spent the past three years thinking about this. I had amazing offers at amazing companies spanning tech and AI, yet I subconsciously couldn't allow myself to go through with them fully. I spent three years digging into my core identity, trying to understand what moves the compass that builds my sense of self. I went through exploring and re-learning all the disciplines I enjoyed through my entire life and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've only wanted one thing in life, and that's to help save lives. I am not built for a doctor — I can't handle blood without feeling like passing out. When I generated the brain model rendering on the <a href="/therapeutics/">therapeutics page</a>, I couldn't stand the realistic-looking human brain I initially had on there. It gave me the heebie-jeebies. What I do know is that science, psychology, and technology have always been my interests — and this work sits at the intersection of all three.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Neil deGrasse Tyson said, the most dangerous thing is not knowing you're wrong because you simply don't know enough. Insight is the teacher of wonder, not experience. I cannot get insight simply by learning — it is by doing. Putting action to experience, and then learning from it. I eventually laid everything out, I mapped how to get there, and this is my first leap.
      </p>

      <h2>The Path Here</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Science</strong> started with my first book. I asked my parents to buy it in 1999 or 2000 — I saw the ad for it in a magazine. It was $19.99. And then in small text it said "10 payments" or something absurd like that. I didn't know what payments were. My parents couldn't read English; they just thought, "Oh, this kid likes planets and space — $19.99, why not?" I remember my dad asking my mom if it was fine. She's the bookkeeper in the family.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Psychology</strong> has always been an interest because I always felt different. I wanted to know myself. I wanted to understand why I thought the way I did. I didn't know that it would be so useful, and I'm regretting that I didn't take that one lab to get a double major. It's never too late though.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Technology</strong> — I fell in love with it when my mom bought me Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. Talk about gamified learning. I wanted to buy some RPG game and remember being there at a bookstore — it might've been Barnes & Noble. I saw the game and she said, "You'll need to learn how to type. It'll be very useful one day." Thank you, Mom. Now I can't stop typing.
      </p>
      <p>
        After we got our first family computer — a Hewlett-Packard — that's when I discovered the good and bad of the internet. I saw some things a kid shouldn't have. I got in trouble. The school didn't mention my name, but everyone knew. It was not good for a kid at that time, but hey, it taught me how to cope with shame and mistakes. We just need to own them in order to really learn the redeeming values that they teach us. Mistakes are what make us all human. Would it have been nice to see knights and castles when I went to middleages.com? Yes, absolutely. That was before the regulations were all put in place to require categorizations for all websites. Oh wait — that's just corporate firewalls. That's how I ensured the environments I was safeguarding detected potential malware. My mentor told me an important thing when he handed the reins of all the corporate firewalls to me to harden and safeguard: security is not about being internet police. I told this to my team whenever they required certain access for security purposes to handle incidents and triage malware. Trust but verify — I always enabled logging, especially out of a healthy fear of insider threat. It's good to instill trust, but also good to be a little paranoid for this career path.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think normal everyday people should ever have to feel insecure when they browse a website. There's nothing more traumatizing than when my AOL used to make random noises at night when you're trying to make designs in the dark so your parents don't know you're using the computer at 5 AM on a school day. And yes, I seriously was designing in Photoshop prior to CS days. No pun intended.
      </p>
      <p>
        That game led me to building my first website at 10 or 11. It was called AGFX, a phpBB board that I co-created with a friend I met on a game called RuneScape. Aaron was a little older than I was and knew much more about web design, so he spun up the servers and showed me how to maintain it. He eventually went to college and I went to high school. Life got busy — you know, girls, and trying to lose all the baby fat from sitting playing RuneScape all day while creating free forum signatures and avatars for community members.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember making a bunch of tutorials for Photoshop, one specifically being featured on TopPhotoshopTutorials.com — for those who know about it, this precedes DeviantArt. I was astounded that my 13-year-old self was able to get a feature simply for trying to find an easier way to create a moon without using so many layers and brushstrokes that other tutorials asked for. I eventually went on to making digital abstract art for wallpapers, backgrounds, and forum members who requested them from me — all for fun. People seemed to like my design.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Neuroethics</h2>
      <p>
        Neuroethics and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand. Cybersecurity is about understanding human psychology and behavior, and creating guardrails and defense mechanisms to prevent accidental exposure — to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This is the core of security, what the industry calls the CIA triad. Ethics is ingrained at its core. When you extend that triad to the brain — to a system where "availability" means a patient's ability to think, "integrity" means the authenticity of their own thoughts, and "confidentiality" means the privacy of their inner experience — you're doing neuroethics whether you call it that or not.
      </p>

      <h2>Why the Hourglass Looks the Way It Does</h2>
      <p>
        I am aware that the QIF layers will evolve and change over time. This is only my iteration based on what I know — and I don't know nearly enough. But what I do know is that I was inspired by a book I picked up while browsing an old bookstore in Istanbul: <em>The Development of the Periodic Law</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Preston_Venable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francis Preston Venable</a>, a chemist and president of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, published in 1896. Ironically, a book from the States found halfway around the world. (Hey UNC — if you're reading and interested in the copy, I'd be more than happy to donate it for record keeping if you don't have one. It's not in the best condition, but a book from 1896 is a fascinating part of history that deserves to be preserved.)
      </p>
      <p>
        What I took away from that book is that it took many, many iterations to get to the periodic table we know today — one that middle schoolers can read. Dozens of scientists proposed competing arrangements before Mendeleev's version stuck, and even his went through revisions. That's what inspired me to start by finding the smallest layers to map out technology and the mind. The fewest yet most effective layers, grounded on the principles of science — something Isaac Newton understood long before I can imagine. I always forget how much of a genius that man was for inventing my biggest kryptonite: calculus. I didn't see any need for it before, but now it's all making sense — why it's important for waves and electromagnetism. Actually, I think that was Maxwell who built on Newton's work. The point is: the foundations compound. Each layer of understanding enables the next, and the hourglass is designed with that same philosophy.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Found</h2>
      <p>
        I started by cataloguing every known BCI attack technique I could find — 60 at first, merged and deduplicated from existing research. Then I asked a different question: <em>what do computers and neurons actually have in common?</em> The answer was physics — signal frequencies. Signals operating at different scales, from raw electromagnetic fields up through cortical oscillations. That insight became QIF's layered architecture, and when I mapped those 60 techniques across the frequency bands, gaps appeared everywhere. Entire attack surfaces that existing taxonomies had missed. The catalogue grew to 102.
      </p>
      <p>
        I traced each technique through the neural pathways it disrupts, the cognitive functions it impairs, and the psychiatric outcomes it can produce. I scored them using a system I designed specifically for neural harm (NISS), because the industry standard (CVSS) was built for servers, not skulls. It cannot express whether damage is reversible to neural tissue or whether the patient can even detect the violation.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I discovered surprised me: <strong>77 of those 102 attack techniques have direct therapeutic counterparts.</strong> The same neural mechanism that can disrupt cognition can also treat a neurological condition. The same stimulation pattern that causes involuntary motor activation in an attack is used therapeutically for Parkinson's disease. This dual-use reality means BCI security cannot be separated from clinical ethics — they are the same problem viewed from different angles.
      </p>
      <p>
        60 techniques map to specific DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses through documented neural pathways. Every single technique implicates at least one neuroright — cognitive liberty, mental privacy, psychological continuity, mental integrity, or cognitive authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mapping process itself keeps uncovering gaps — not just in attacks, but in the ethical frameworks meant to protect against them. When I scored all 102 techniques against the four established neurorights proposed by Ienca and Andorno, one genuine gap emerged: no framework distinguishes <em>reading</em> neural data from <em>writing</em> into neural signals. Mental Privacy covers confidentiality — don't read my brain without consent. But what about injecting false signals? That's a different class of violation, and it needed its own right: <strong>Cognitive Authenticity</strong>. QIF also extends Mental Integrity with engineering-level signal dynamics protections and Mental Privacy with data-lifecycle protections. The framework doesn't just catalogue what's known; it exposes what's missing.
      </p>

      <h2>The Framework</h2>
      <p>
        Qinnovate's Neural Atlas bridges three domains — two that share deep roots, and a third that has rarely been at the table:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong> — Layered defense models, threat taxonomies, attack surface analysis, and vulnerability scoring</li>
        <li><strong>Neuroscience</strong> — Neuroanatomy, neural signaling pathways, clinical outcomes, and the DSM-5-TR diagnostic framework</li>
        <li><strong>Neuroethics</strong> — Neurorights frameworks, informed consent in neural contexts, cognitive liberty, and the governance of technologies that interface with the mind</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result is the <strong>Hourglass Model</strong>: an 11-band, 3-zone architecture with the Neural Interface (I0 — the physical BCI device) at its waist. Biology above. Silicon below. The <a href="/TARA/">TARA Atlas</a> maps 102 techniques across this hierarchy, each scored with NISS and traced to clinical outcomes through the Neural Impact Chain.
      </p>

      <h2>Situating the Work</h2>
      <p>
        This project builds on and extends existing scholarship in neuroethics and neurorights. Marcello Ienca and Roberto Andorno's foundational proposal for four neurorights (cognitive liberty, mental privacy, mental integrity, psychological continuity) provides the philosophical basis. Rafael Yuste and the NeuroRights Foundation's advocacy — including their work with Chile's constitutional neurorights amendment in 2021 — demonstrates the urgency of operationalizing these rights. UNESCO's 2025 Recommendation on the Ethics of Neurotechnology — adopted at the 43rd session of the General Conference — establishes the international governance context.
      </p>
      <p>
        What has been missing is the technical bridge: a systematic methodology for tracing how <em>specific</em> security vulnerabilities violate <em>specific</em> neurorights through <em>documented</em> neural pathways. QIF attempts to provide that bridge — translating abstract rights into auditable technical requirements. This work is one contribution to a growing field, not a final answer. It is published openly for exactly that reason: to be evaluated, critiqued, and improved by the community.
      </p>

      <h2>What the Framework Cannot Answer</h2>
      <p>
        The Neural Atlas operationalizes seven neurorights — four established by Ienca and Andorno (cognitive liberty, mental privacy, mental integrity, psychological continuity) and three discovered through TARA's threat analysis (cognitive authenticity, dynamical integrity, informational disassociation). But three important rights proposed by Yuste and the NeuroRights Foundation — <strong>equitable access to mental augmentation</strong>, <strong>protection from algorithmic bias</strong>, and <strong>free will</strong> — are not directly addressable through a security framework. No attack technique violates "fair access." No threat vector produces "algorithmic bias." These are questions of justice, policy, and philosophy that a technical threat taxonomy cannot resolve on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe those answers will build themselves over time — precisely <em>because</em> this work is open source. When the framework, the threat data, and the scoring methodology are freely available, the community that forms around them will ask the questions I haven't thought of yet. As I pursue a master's in Neuroethics and Bioethics, I expect many more of these questions to surface — questions that will help me properly implement the foundations I've been building. The framework is a starting point, not a finish line. The rights it cannot yet operationalize are the ones I most need to study.
      </p>

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Everything is open: open publication, transparent methodology, publicly available framework documents, equations, and reference implementations. Neural security research must be developed in the open — not behind closed doors. The people whose brains will be connected deserve to understand exactly how they're protected.
      </p>

      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Normal users of the internet shouldn't have to worry about visiting a website and accidentally having a man-in-the-middle deliver ransomware to their computer. That should be left to the professionals — and yet, the tools we built to create what we call the modern internet are still relics of an era that didn't anticipate the threats we face today. The future state has so much room for improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brain-computer interfaces represent a fresh slate. It's not often that society arrives at a truly pivotal moment in technology — a chance to build something right from the beginning, rather than retrofitting security onto a system that was never designed for it. To me, BCIs are that digital leap: a chance to ensure that the next generation of human-computer interaction is secure by design, not by afterthought. And ensuring we still remain the definition of human at our core — that's where neuroethics comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm glad the days of browser pop-ups are no longer a major concern. But the next frontier is adversaries looking to fingerprint our actual thoughts. The future I envision is one that is achievable, and this is the work that gets us there — collectively.
      </p>

      <h2>How AI Was Used</h2>
      <p>
        My goal with AI — predominantly Claude, alongside Gemini and ChatGPT — was to help lay my ideas out as they evolved. I could dissect the sections that needed further development while AI agents helped validate the research and tie together the pieces I mapped out. The architecture, the scoring, the clinical mappings, the cross-domain connections — those are mine. AI helped me get the work out of my head and into a form that others can evaluate.
      </p>
      <p>
        But AI cannot replace what comes next. I need real humans — academics, clinicians, neuroscientists, and like-minded intellectuals who share a vision for a future without the anxiety and baggage that comes with today's digital landscape. The <a href="https://github.com/qinnovates/qinnovate/blob/main/governance/TRANSPARENCY.md">Transparency Statement</a> documents every AI interaction, with GPG-signed monthly checksums for verification. The <a href="https://github.com/qinnovates/qinnovate/blob/main/qif-framework/QIF-DERIVATION-LOG.md">Derivation Log</a> traces 57 entries of human decision-making — every architectural choice, every pivot, every dead end — so that any reviewer can follow the same reasoning chain and challenge it with better reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is still so much for me to answer. I hope to share my learnings with the world as I continue working on this project through school, and I believe we'll be hearing from more and more humans in the loop.
      </p>

      <h2>The Questions Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        I do not want to answer what consciousness is. I'm not sure anyone can — and I think that's the point. What I do know is that we are already brain-computer interfaces in a meaningful sense. The average person checks their phone over 100 times a day. We offload memory to search engines, navigation to GPS, social reasoning to feeds curated by algorithms we don't control. The boundary between mind and machine blurred long before anyone implanted an electrode.
      </p>
      <p>
        BCIs just make that boundary physical. And that changes the stakes entirely. Consider: a brain-computer interface that restores sight to the blind is something every person on earth would hope exists. The therapeutic potential is extraordinary. But the same interface that restores vision can, in principle, inject false visual percepts. The same device that treats Parkinson's can induce involuntary movement. The dual-use problem isn't hypothetical — it's inherent to the physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        A disclaimer: the Neural Atlas is not meant — and shall never be meant — to answer what consciousness is. That question is above all of our paygrade. What the framework <em>does</em> address is the engineering reality: the technologies we're building will interact with a system whose full capabilities we haven't mapped yet. The pace of scientific discovery is accelerating — boundaries we assumed were settled are dissolving — and a security framework for neural interfaces needs to be designed with that humility built in.
      </p>
      <p>
        What helps me sleep is studying. Pursuing bioethics and neuroethics alongside this technical work, surrounded by diverse academic perspectives, is how I plan to earn the right to ask better questions. Not alone — in dialogue with clinicians, philosophers, neuroscientists, and engineers who see the same urgency.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of Qinnovate is not to provide final answers. It's to start the right questions — and hopefully inspire another generation of thinkers to help answer the ones that will emerge as we learn more about the mysteries of the mind. The key is doing this thoughtfully: advancing without recklessness, questioning without paralysis. Being aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_process_theory">Wegner-Schneider effect</a> — the psychological finding that trying to suppress a thought only makes it more persistent — reminds me that ignoring these risks doesn't make them disappear. The only path forward is through: studying them openly, building safeguards deliberately, and trusting that transparency invites better thinking than secrecy ever could.
