## Executive Summary

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) represent one of the most consequential technological developments of the 21st century. As these devices transition from research laboratories to consumer markets, the regulatory framework governing their deployment will determine whether this technology serves humanity or endangers it.

**The ONI Framework establishes security and safety standards that complement—and in some cases exceed—existing regulatory requirements.** This document maps ONI compliance to US federal and state regulations, international frameworks, and emerging neurotechnology legislation worldwide, identifying gaps that manufacturers, regulators, and policymakers must address before mass BCI adoption.

> **Key Principle:** Mass adoption of BCIs is inevitable. The question is not *whether* but *how*. ONI-compliant devices prioritize security, privacy, and human sovereignty from the design phase—not as regulatory afterthoughts.

---

## Why Compliance Matters Now

### The Regulatory Window

We are currently in a critical regulatory window. BCIs are transitioning from:

| Phase | Characteristics | Regulatory Posture |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Research** (2000-2020) | Academic labs, small cohorts, IRB oversight | Minimal commercial regulation |
| **Early Clinical** (2020-2026) | FDA breakthrough designations, compassionate use | Emerging medical device framework |
| **Consumer Transition** (2026-2030) | Non-invasive consumer devices, wellness claims | Regulatory gap — unclear jurisdiction |
| **Mass Adoption** (2030+) | Widespread deployment, critical infrastructure | **Urgent need for comprehensive framework** |

### Consequences of Delayed Action

| Risk Category | Without Proactive Regulation | With ONI-Compliant Framework |
|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Security Incidents** | Neural ransomware, cognitive hijacking, mass exploitation | Defense-in-depth, attack detection, rapid response |
| **Privacy Violations** | Thought surveillance, neural data harvesting, identity theft | Encrypted transport, data minimization, consent enforcement |
| **Public Trust** | Backlash, adoption resistance, restrictive legislation | Informed adoption, transparent security, ethical deployment |
| **International Competition** | Fragmented standards, race to bottom | Unified standards, global interoperability |

---

## US Regulatory Landscape

### Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

The FDA is the primary regulator for medical BCIs in the United States. BCI devices fall under the Medical Device classification.

#### Device Classification

| Class | Risk Level | Examples | Regulatory Pathway |
|-------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Class I** | Low | External EEG headbands (wellness) | General Controls, Exempt |
| **Class II** | Moderate | Non-invasive neurofeedback, cochlear implants | 510(k) Premarket Notification |
| **Class III** | High | Implanted neural interfaces, deep brain stimulators | Premarket Approval (PMA) |

#### Key FDA Regulations

| Regulation | Citation | ONI Alignment |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| **Quality System Regulation** | 21 CFR Part 820 | ONI L8-L14 validation checkpoints map to design controls |
| **Medical Device Reporting** | 21 CFR Part 803 | NSAM alerting provides adverse event detection |
| **Unique Device Identification** | 21 CFR Part 830 | ONI node identification supports UDI requirements |
| **Cybersecurity Guidance** | FDA-2023-D-0100 | **Direct alignment** — ONI exceeds current FDA cyber guidance |
| **Software as Medical Device** | IMDRF/SaMD | ONI firmware security addresses SaMD concerns |

#### FDA Breakthrough Device Designation

Several BCI companies have received Breakthrough Device Designation:

- **Synchron** — Stentrode endovascular BCI
- **Blackrock Neurotech** — Utah Array systems
- **Neuralink** — N1 implant
- **Paradromics** — High-bandwidth cortical interface

> **ONI Recommendation:** Breakthrough designation should require demonstrated cybersecurity architecture. Current designation focuses on therapeutic benefit without mandating security standards.

#### FDA Cybersecurity Requirements

The FDA's 2023 guidance on cybersecurity for medical devices establishes:

| Requirement | FDA Expectation | ONI Implementation |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Threat Modeling** | Identify attack vectors | ONI 14-layer attack surface mapping |
| **Security by Design** | Built-in security controls | L8 Neural Firewall, coherence validation |
| **Software Bill of Materials** | Component transparency | ONI component registry |
| **Vulnerability Management** | Ongoing security updates | NSAM continuous monitoring |
| **Incident Response** | Breach detection/response | Alert escalation, quarantine protocols |

---

### Federal Communications Commission (FCC)

BCIs with wireless capabilities fall under FCC jurisdiction for electromagnetic emissions and spectrum use.

#### Applicable Regulations

| Regulation | Scope | BCI Relevance |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| **47 CFR Part 15** | Unlicensed devices | Consumer EEG, Bluetooth/WiFi BCIs |
| **47 CFR Part 18** | Industrial/scientific/medical | Medical-grade implants |
| **47 CFR Part 95** | Medical Device Radio (MICS) | Implanted device telemetry |
| **SAR Limits** | Specific Absorption Rate | RF exposure near brain tissue |

#### ONI-FCC Alignment

| FCC Concern | ONI Solution |
|-------------|--------------|
| Electromagnetic interference | L1-L2 signal integrity validation |
| Unauthorized transmission | L8 firewall blocks rogue RF |
| Spectrum security | Transport layer authentication |

---

### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

Neural data constitutes Protected Health Information (PHI) under HIPAA when collected in healthcare contexts.

#### HIPAA Requirements

| Rule | Requirements | ONI Alignment |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Privacy Rule** | Minimum necessary use, patient consent, disclosure limits | ONI data minimization, consent framework |
| **Security Rule** | Administrative, physical, technical safeguards | ONI L6-L14 encryption, access controls |
| **Breach Notification** | 60-day notification for breaches >500 individuals | NSAM detection enables rapid breach identification |

#### Neural Data Classification

| Data Type | HIPAA Status | ONI Protection |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Raw EEG/neural signals | PHI if linked to individual | Encrypted at L6, anonymized at L10 |
| Decoded intentions/commands | PHI — highly sensitive | Never stored, processed ephemerally |
| Cognitive state inferences | PHI — derived health data | Kohno taxonomy protection |
| Device telemetry | PHI if linked | Pseudonymized device IDs |

> **Critical Gap:** HIPAA was designed for medical records, not real-time neural streams. New regulatory frameworks are needed for continuous neural data flows.

---

### Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

The FTC regulates consumer BCIs marketed outside medical contexts (wellness, productivity, gaming).

#### FTC Authority

| Area | FTC Concern | ONI Relevance |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Deceptive Practices** | False claims about BCI capabilities | Honest coherence reporting |
| **Unfair Practices** | Inadequate data security | ONI security baseline |
| **Children's Privacy (COPPA)** | Under-13 protections | Pediatric BCI considerations |
| **Health Claims** | Wellness vs. medical distinctions | Clear device classification |

#### FTC Enforcement Actions (Precedents)

| Case | Relevance to BCIs |
|------|-------------------|
| **FTC v. Lumosity (2016)** | Brain training claims must be substantiated |
| **FTC v. Practice Fusion (2020)** | Health tech data practices scrutinized |
| **FTC v. BetterHelp (2023)** | Mental health data requires heightened protection |

---

### National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

NIST provides cybersecurity frameworks that apply to BCI manufacturers.

#### Applicable Frameworks

| Framework | Application | ONI Mapping |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** | Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover | ONI lifecycle security |
| **NIST SP 800-53** | Security and Privacy Controls | ONI control implementation |
| **NIST SP 800-183** | Networks of Things | L1-L7 network security |
| **NIST AI RMF** | AI Risk Management | Cognitive layer (L13-L14) governance |

#### NIST CSF → ONI Mapping

| NIST Function | NIST Categories | ONI Implementation |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **IDENTIFY** | Asset Management, Risk Assessment | 14-layer asset inventory, attack surface mapping |
| **PROTECT** | Access Control, Data Security, Maintenance | L8 Firewall, Coherence validation, secure updates |
| **DETECT** | Anomalies, Continuous Monitoring | NSAM, Scale-frequency anomaly detection |
| **RESPOND** | Response Planning, Communications | Alert escalation, quarantine protocols |
| **RECOVER** | Recovery Planning, Improvements | Failsafe modes, post-incident learning |

---

### State-Level Regulations

Several US states have enacted neural data protections, with a growing wave of legislation since 2024.

#### Enacted State Legislation

| State | Legislation | Effective | Key Provisions |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Colorado** | H.B. 24-1058 (Neurotechnology Privacy) | August 2024 | First US state law explicitly protecting neural data; classifies neural data as "sensitive data" under the Colorado Privacy Act; requires opt-in consent for collection; prohibits neural data sale without consent |
| **California** | SB 1223 (Neurorights Act) | January 2025 | Amends CCPA to include neural data as "sensitive personal information"; grants right to delete neural data; prohibits neural data sale without explicit consent; covers both medical and consumer neurotechnology |
| **Montana** | SB 163 (Neural Data Privacy) | October 2025 | Classifies neural data as protected health information; requires informed consent for neural data collection; establishes penalties for unauthorized neural data access |
| **Connecticut** | SB 1295 (Neurotechnology Protection) | July 2026 | Comprehensive neurotechnology consumer protection; requires transparency in neural data processing; establishes neural data minimization requirements |

#### Proposed State Legislation

| State | Legislation | Status | Key Provisions |
|-------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| **Minnesota** | HF 1370 | Proposed 2024 | Neural data consent requirements |
| **New York** | A8749 | Proposed 2024 | Brain-computer interface privacy |

#### California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Implications

With SB 1223 (effective January 2025), California's CCPA now explicitly covers neural data:

| CCPA Right | Neural Data Application |
|------------|------------------------|
| Right to Know | What neural data is collected, including inferred cognitive states |
| Right to Delete | Erasure of neural recordings and derived data |
| Right to Opt-Out | Decline neural data sale — explicit opt-in required for sensitive neural data |
| Right to Non-Discrimination | No penalties for exercising neural data rights |

> **ONI Position:** While state-level action demonstrates urgency, fragmentation creates compliance complexity. Federal neural data legislation is needed — see the MIND Act below.

---

### US Federal Legislation

#### MIND Act (S. 2925)

The **Mental-health Innovation and Neurotechnology Development (MIND) Act** (S. 2925), introduced in September 2025, represents the first US federal bill specifically addressing neurotechnology governance.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Bill Number** | S. 2925 |
| **Introduced** | September 2025 |
| **Sponsors** | Bipartisan coalition |
| **Status** | Committee consideration |
| **Scope** | Federal neurotechnology standards, neural data protection, research ethics |

Key provisions:
- Establishes federal standards for neural data collection, storage, and sharing
- Creates a Neurotechnology Advisory Committee under HHS
- Mandates cybersecurity requirements for neural devices receiving federal funding
- Requires informed consent standards for neurotechnology research
- Addresses Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later threats to neural data

> **ONI Alignment:** The MIND Act's cybersecurity requirements align directly with ONI's 14-layer security model. ONI-compliant devices would meet or exceed the proposed federal standards.
