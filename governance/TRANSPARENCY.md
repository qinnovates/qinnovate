## Methodology: The Cognitive Division

### Core Principle

Every contribution is categorized by its cognitive origin. AI assistance is treated as a tool subject to human oversight, not a collaborator with independent judgment on ethical or novel technical matters.

### Contribution Matrix

| Domain | Human Contribution | AI Contribution | Boundary Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Conceptual Architecture** | Original 14-layer ONI model design, attack surface identification, layer-to-ethics mapping | None | Purely human ideation; AI was not consulted on framework structure |
| **v3.0/v3.1 Hourglass Architecture** | All 6 architectural decisions (7-band, 3-1-3 symmetry, N3 rename, amygdala split, cerebellum spanning, QI range philosophy), rejection of N4 band | Co-derivation of hourglass geometry (Entries 1-13), research agent validation (102 sources), implementation across codebase | Human made all final decisions; AI proposed options and implemented choices. See Derivation Log Entries 14-15. |
| **Mathematical Formulas** | Cₛ coherence metric conception, variable selection (σ²φ, σ²τ, σ²γ), security interpretations | LaTeX formatting, notation consistency | Human selected which variances matter for security; AI formatted |
| **Security Decisions** | Zero-trust architecture choice, firewall placement at L8, rejection thresholds | None | All security-critical decisions made by human judgment |
| **Quantum Security Concepts** | TTT as security primitive, QPUF authentication proposal, liminal phase hypothesis | Literature organization | Novel security applications are human contributions |
| **Code Implementation** | Algorithm design, API decisions, security-critical logic | Syntax generation, boilerplate, docstrings | Human reviewed all generated code for security implications |
| **Research Synthesis** | Source selection, relevance judgment, argument construction, conclusions | Initial literature summaries | All AI summaries verified against primary sources |
| **Technical Writing** | All original analysis, ethical arguments, novel hypotheses | Structural suggestions, grammar, APA formatting | Human wrote arguments; AI assisted with presentation |

## The Refinement Loop: Human-in-the-Loop Evidence

### Documented Corrections

The following examples demonstrate active human oversight correcting AI output:

#### Example 1: Quantum Coherence Timescales
- **AI Initial Output**: Suggested biological quantum coherence persists for ~10 milliseconds
- **Human Correction**: Rejected; actual biological coherence timescales are ~100 femtoseconds (Engel et al., 2007)
- **Action Taken**: Corrected in TechDoc-Quantum_Encryption.md with proper citation
- **Lesson**: AI hallucinated a plausible-sounding but incorrect value by three orders of magnitude

#### Example 2: Encryption Architecture
- **AI Initial Output**: Suggested symmetric encryption for neural signal authentication
- **Human Override**: Rejected due to key distribution vulnerability in implanted devices
- **Action Taken**: Pivoted to QPUF-based authentication as documented in quantum-encryption publications
- **Ethical Reasoning**: Key distribution in BCIs creates attack surface for "harvest now, decrypt later" scenarios affecting long-term cognitive autonomy

#### Example 3: Transport Variance Defaults
- **AI Initial Output**: Suggested using uniform reliability factors (all 0.95)
- **Human Override**: Rejected; biological pathways have heterogeneous reliability
- **Action Taken**: Researched actual synaptic transmission reliability (~0.85), myelination effects, etc.
- **Lesson**: AI defaulted to simplified assumptions that would reduce biological validity

**Expanded Analysis — Why Synaptic Reliability Dominates:**

The Coherence Metric (Cₛ) combines three variance components: phase (σ²φ), transport (σ²τ), and gain (σ²γ). Understanding *why* transport variance dominates required multiple iterations:

1. **Biological Reality of Synaptic Transmission**: Synaptic vesicle release is inherently probabilistic — approximately 85% reliable per synapse (Branco & Bhalla, 2006; Del Castillo & Katz, 1954). This isn't a defect; it's a feature enabling neural plasticity and energy efficiency.

2. **Compounding Effect Across Pathways**: Neural signals traverse multi-synaptic pathways. For a 3-synapse pathway: 0.85³ ≈ 0.61 reliability. For 5 synapses: 0.85⁵ ≈ 0.44. This exponential degradation means transport variance accumulates faster than phase or gain variance.

3. **Why This Matters for Security**: An attacker cannot easily *improve* transport reliability — it's biologically constrained. However, they can *exploit* it by injecting signals that appear to have unnaturally high reliability (>0.95), which should trigger anomaly detection. Signals with *too perfect* transmission are as suspicious as degraded ones.

4. **The Learning Moment**: AI's suggestion of uniform 0.95 reliability would have:

   - **Overestimated baseline signal quality**: A 0.95 reliability assumption is 10 percentage points higher than biological reality (~0.85). This might seem like a small difference, but compounded across pathways it dramatically shifts expectations. At 0.95³ = 0.86 reliability for 3 synapses vs. 0.85³ = 0.61 — the AI's assumption would predict 40% higher pathway reliability than actually exists. Any coherence threshold calibrated on these inflated baselines would be fundamentally miscalibrated.

   - **Missed a key attack detection vector (supranormal reliability)**: "Supranormal" means *above the normal biological range*. If real synapses transmit at ~85% reliability, a signal showing 95%+ reliability is biologically implausible — it's *too clean*. This is a critical security insight: attackers injecting synthetic signals into a BCI cannot easily replicate the natural "messiness" of biological transmission. Their signals will be suspiciously reliable. By using 0.95 as our baseline, we would have normalized this attack signature, making it invisible to detection. The 0.95 threshold matters specifically because it sits at the boundary of biological plausibility — signals above this should trigger immediate scrutiny.

   - **Ignored decades of neuroscience research on synaptic stochasticity**: The probabilistic nature of synaptic transmission has been documented since Katz's Nobel Prize-winning work in the 1950s-70s (Del Castillo & Katz, 1954). This isn't obscure knowledge — it's foundational neuroscience. The AI's "clean" assumption of 0.95 revealed a pattern: AI systems optimize for mathematical elegance (uniform, high values) rather than biological fidelity (heterogeneous, lower values). This is precisely the kind of domain-specific knowledge that requires human oversight.

   **Why 0.95 Specifically?** The AI likely selected 0.95 because it's a common "high confidence" placeholder in engineering contexts (like 95% confidence intervals). But this reveals a category error: applying statistical conventions to biological systems. Real synapses don't care about human statistical preferences — they evolved under constraints of energy efficiency, plasticity, and noise tolerance that produce ~85% reliability as an *optimal* tradeoff, not a limitation.

This example illustrates why domain expertise cannot be fully offloaded to AI — the AI optimized for "clean" assumptions while biological systems operate on "messy" realities that carry security-relevant information. The mess *is* the signal.

#### Example 4: Firewall Decision Matrix
- **AI Initial Output**: Suggested binary accept/reject based solely on coherence score
- **Human Enhancement**: Added authentication requirement and ACCEPT_FLAG intermediate state
- **Reasoning**: Zero-trust principles require identity verification independent of signal quality
- **Action Taken**: Implemented full decision matrix with alert levels

#### Example 5: Coherence Formula Notation Correction (2026-01-26)
- **Legacy Notation**: `Cₛ = Σᵢ wᵢ × Φᵢ(Δtᵢ) × Θᵢ(fᵢ, Aᵢ)` (weighted sum representation)
- **Authoritative Formula**: `Cₛ = e^(−(σ²φ + σ²τ + σ²γ))` (exponential decay)
- **Discovery Process**: Systematic repository audit found 8 files containing the legacy notation that contradicted the authoritative TechDoc and code implementation
- **Mathematical Proof**:
  1. The exponential form models biological threshold behaviors (Markram et al., 1997 — STDP windows)
  2. Formula is derived from Shannon entropy: Cₛ = e^(−H_total) where H_total = total variance
  3. Produces bounded output [0, 1] with proper asymptotic behavior (Cₛ → 1 as variance → 0)
  4. All 14 unit tests in `test_coherence.py` explicitly verify e^−x behavior
  5. Both `oni-framework` and `tara_mvp` implementations use `math.exp(-total_variance)`
- **Files Corrected**: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, TARA/API.md, TARA/CLAUDE.md, PERSONAS.md, app.py, CoherenceGauge.tsx, coherence.tsx
- **Lesson**: Legacy notation from early development propagated to auxiliary documentation without review against authoritative sources. This underscores the importance of establishing clear truth hierarchies (TechDoc > Implementation > Supporting docs).

### Correction Rate

Across the development of ONI Framework v0.1.0:
- **Total AI suggestions reviewed**: ~200+
- **Accepted without modification**: ~60%
- **Accepted with modification**: ~25%

## Cognitive Boundary Maintenance

### The Challenge

Using AI for efficiency creates a risk: cognitive offloading may trade deep understanding for breadth. This tension is directly relevant to neuroethics, where we ask similar questions about neural augmentation.

### Self-Assessment

**Where AI Helped Understanding:**
- Rapid literature survey revealed connections I might have missed
- Forcing clear documentation improved my own conceptual clarity
- Debugging conversations exposed gaps in my reasoning

**Where AI Hindered Understanding:**
- Initial over-reliance on AI-structured outlines delayed developing my own organizational logic
- Transport variance defaults required multiple iterations before I fully internalized *why* synaptic transmission reliability (0.85) dominates the coherence penalty (see Example 3 in Refinement Loop for detailed analysis). The AI's "clean" assumptions obscured the biological insight that stochastic synaptic release is both a constraint *and* a security feature — understanding this required returning to primary neuroscience literature and reasoning through the exponential compounding effect myself.
- Some nuances only became clear when I had to explain AI errors

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Mandatory "explain it without AI" check for core concepts
- Periodic manual writing sessions to maintain voice and reasoning skills
- Deliberate engagement with primary sources, not just AI summaries

## Tool Disclosure

### AI Tools Used

| Tool | Version/Model | Use Case | Contribution Level |
|------|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| ChatGPT (OpenAI) | GPT-4 / GPT-4o | **Week 1 (mid-Jan 2026)** — idea bouncing, initial concept exploration. Used to externalize and stress-test framework ideas the author had been developing for years. | Exploratory (Week 1) |
| Claude (Anthropic) | Claude Opus 4.5 | Code assistance, documentation drafting, research synthesis, co-derivation of hourglass model. **Primary tool from repo creation (2026-01-18) onward.** | Primary |
| Claude Code | CLI | Repository management, file operations, git workflows, agent orchestration | Primary |
| Claude Research Agents | 3 specialized (quantum physics, neuroscience, cybersecurity) | Validation of v3.1 architecture against 102 external sources | Validation |
| Gemini (Google) | Gemini 2.5 (CLI) | **Independent peer review** — full whitepaper critique with no prior context (cross-AI validation) | Validation |
| Gemini (Google) | Gemini 1.5/2.0 | Research verification, cross-model validation, alternative perspectives | Secondary |
| LMArena (LMSYS) | Blind comparison | Unbiased initial concept exploration, cross-model validation | Exploratory |

**Note on Multi-Model Approach**: Using multiple AI models serves as a form of epistemic hygiene — cross-referencing outputs between ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude, and blind comparisons via LMArena helps identify model-specific biases or hallucinations. When models disagree, human judgment adjudicates by consulting primary sources.

**Note on Chronological Progression**: Before the repository was created, the author used ChatGPT during the first week (mid-January 2026) to bounce ideas and externalize a framework vision that had been forming over years of thinking about BCI security, neuroscience, and quantum mechanics. Claude became the primary tool from repo creation (2026-01-18) onward, handling implementation, documentation, and co-derivation of the mathematical framework. For the complete timestamped timeline of every AI interaction, see the [AI Collaboration Timeline in QIF-DERIVATION-LOG.md](../../../drafts/ai-working/QIF-DERIVATION-LOG.md#ai-collaboration-timeline).

**Note on Cross-AI Validation (added 2026-02-02)**: To counteract potential confirmation bias from the primary development AI (Claude), significant framework changes now trigger an independent review by a different AI system (Gemini 2.5 via CLI). The reviewing AI receives the full whitepaper with no prior context and is instructed to provide unsoftened criticism. This is formalized in the [Validation Pipeline](../../../drafts/ai-working/PROPAGATION.md) (Section E). Results are logged in the [Derivation Log](../../../drafts/ai-working/QIF-DERIVATION-LOG.md).

**Note on Automatic Documentation (added 2026-02-03)**: All multi-AI validation sessions, architectural reviews, and significant framework decisions are now **automatically documented** in both the Derivation Log and this Transparency Statement at the time they occur. This includes: which AI systems were involved, what roles they played, what the human decided vs. what AI suggested, and the rationale for the decision. This practice is mandatory for all future sessions — not retroactive documentation, but real-time audit trail creation.

### Cross-AI Validation Sessions

| Date | Topic | AI Systems | Human Decision | Derivation Log |
|------|-------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| 2026-02-02 | QIF v3.1 whitepaper review | Gemini 2.5 (independent critique) | Accepted structural feedback, rejected some scope suggestions | Entry #16 |
| 2026-02-03 | ONI L8 positioning + L14 consciousness scope | Gemini 2.5 (independent review) + Claude Opus 4.5 (research agent) + Aurora (synthesis) | PENDING — awaiting results | Entry #20 |
