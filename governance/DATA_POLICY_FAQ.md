## 1. Data Collection Overview

### What Data Does ONI Process?

| Data Type | Processed Locally | Transmitted to TARA | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Raw neural signals | ✅ Yes | ❌ **Never** | Waveforms, spike trains, ERP components |
| Decoded thoughts/intentions | ✅ Yes | ❌ **Never** | Semantic content never extracted |
| Coherence Score (Cₛ) | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ **With protections** | See anonymization section |
| Delta (Δ) rate of change | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ **With protections** | Trend direction only |
| Deviation (σ) from baseline | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ **With protections** | Anomaly magnitude |
| Threshold alerts | ✅ Yes | ✅ Categorical only | LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL |
| Device health metrics | ✅ Yes | ✅ Aggregated | Battery, connection quality |

### Core Principle: Local-First Processing

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     YOUR DEVICE (Local)                          │
│                                                                  │
│  Raw Neural Signals → Variance Calculation → Cₛ Score           │
│         ↑                                        ↓               │

```

## 2. Privacy Architecture

### Zero-Knowledge Monitoring

TARA monitors neural security without accessing neural content:

1. **Mathematical Reduction:** Raw signals → variance components → single Cₛ score
2. **One-Way Transformation:** Cannot reconstruct signals from scores (mathematically proven)
3. **Categorical Alerts:** Threshold breaches transmitted as categories, not values

### Who Monitors the Data?

| Entity | Access Level | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **User** | Full | Complete access to all local data |
| **Device** | Full | Local processing and protection |
| **TARA Stack** | Scores only | Security monitoring, anomaly detection |
| **AI Models** | Encrypted gradients only | Collective learning (federated) |
| **ONI Team** | Aggregate statistics only | Framework improvement |
| **Third Parties** | ❌ None | Never sold, shared, or accessed |

### Federated AI Training

AI models improve without centralizing data:

```
Device A ──┐                    ┌── Improved Model
Device B ──┼── Encrypted ──────►│   (same for all)
Device C ──┤   Gradients        └── Downloaded to
Device D ──┘       │                 all devices
                   ▼
           Secure Aggregation
           (sees no individual data)
```

## 3. Anonymization & Known Vulnerabilities

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Score Fingerprinting Vulnerability

**The Problem:** Even without raw neural data, Cₛ scores over time can create identifiable patterns.

| Risk | Description | Severity |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Neural Fingerprinting** | Unique variance patterns in how your coherence fluctuates | High |
| **Activity Inference** | Sudden Cₛ drops may correlate with specific cognitive states | Medium |
| **Re-identification** | Matching score patterns across sessions to identify users | High |
| **Temporal Correlation** | Time-series analysis revealing daily/weekly patterns | Medium |

### Why Simple Hashing Doesn't Work

Hashing (SHA-256, etc.) would make scores incomparable. We need to:
- Compare scores over time (trend detection)
- Detect threshold breaches (Cₛ < 0.6)
- Aggregate statistics across users

**Hashed scores = no useful monitoring.**

### Implemented Mitigations

| Mitigation | How It Works | Trade-off |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Differential Privacy** | Add calibrated Laplacian noise: Cₛ' = Cₛ + Lap(1/ε) | Slight accuracy loss (ε ≈ 1.0) |
| **Bucketed Transmission** | Send LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH instead of 0.847 | Loses precision for trends |
| **Temporal Aggregation** | 30-second windows for monitoring, 5-minute for training | Delayed detection |
| **Session Unlinkability** | Rotating pseudonyms per session | Cannot track long-term trends |
| **k-Anonymity** | Only transmit when indistinguishable from k-1 others | May delay alerts |

### Recommended Configuration

```python
# Default privacy settings (can be adjusted by user)
privacy_config = {
    "differential_privacy": {
        "enabled": True,
        "epsilon": 1.0,  # Privacy budget
    },
    "bucketed_transmission": {
        "enabled": True,
        "buckets": ["LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH", "CRITICAL"],
    },
    "temporal_aggregation": {
        "monitoring_window_seconds": 30,
        "training_window_seconds": 300,
    },
    "session_unlinkability": {
        "enabled": True,
        "pseudonym_rotation_hours": 24,
    },
}
```

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

#### Q: What is the ONI Framework?
**A:** ONI (Open Neurosecurity Interoperability) is an open-source security framework for brain-computer interfaces. It defines 14 layers spanning silicon (traditional computing) to synapse (biological neural activity), providing standardized security measures at each level.

#### Q: Is ONI a surveillance tool?
**A:** **No.** ONI is explicitly designed for **defense and protection**, not surveillance. The framework:
- Never decodes thoughts or intentions
- Never transmits raw neural data
- Exists to protect users FROM unauthorized access
- Prioritizes user sovereignty and cognitive freedom

See our [Privacy & Ethics Statement](../README.md#privacy--ethics-statement) for our formal commitment.

#### Q: Who created ONI?
**A:** ONI was created by Kevin Qi (qikevinl) with AI assistance from Claude (Anthropic). It builds on academic research from the University of Washington (Kohno et al.), Columbia, Yale, and other institutions. All contributions are documented in our [Transparency Statement](TRANSPARENCY.md).

### Data & Privacy Questions

#### Q: Does TARA see my thoughts?
**A:** **No.** TARA only receives mathematical scores (Cₛ, Δ, σ) that indicate signal quality and security status. These scores cannot be reverse-engineered into thoughts, memories, or neural content. It's like knowing someone's heart rate without knowing what they're thinking about.

#### Q: Can my coherence scores identify me?
**A:** **This is a known vulnerability we actively mitigate.** Time-series of Cₛ scores could theoretically create identifiable patterns. We address this through:
- Differential privacy (adding calibrated noise)
- Bucketed transmission (categories instead of exact values)
- Temporal aggregation (windowed averages)
- Session pseudonyms (rotating identifiers)

See [Section 3](#3-anonymization--known-vulnerabilities) for full details.

#### Q: Who can access my data?
**A:**
- **You:** Full access to all your data
- **TARA Platform:** Anonymized scores only (with mitigations)
- **AI Models:** Encrypted gradients only (federated learning)
- **Third Parties:** Never. Data is never sold, shared, or accessed by external parties.

#### Q: How long is my data retained?
**A:**
- **Local device:** User-controlled retention
- **TARA platform:** Anonymized scores retained for 90 days for security analysis, then aggregated
- **AI training:** Gradients are ephemeral (used once, then discarded)
- **Aggregate statistics:** Retained indefinitely (fully anonymized)

#### Q: Can I delete my data?
**A:** Yes. Users have the right to:
- Delete all local data at any time
- Request deletion of TARA-side scores
- Opt out of federated learning
- Export all data in portable format

See [Section 5: User Rights](#5-user-rights).

---

### Technical Questions

#### Q: What is the Coherence Score (Cₛ)?
**A:** The Coherence Score measures signal quality and trustworthiness:

```
Cₛ = e^(−(σ²φ + σ²τ + σ²γ))
```

Where:
- σ²φ = Phase variance (timing jitter)
- σ²τ = Transport variance (pathway integrity)
- σ²γ = Gain variance (amplitude stability)

**Interpretation:**
- Cₛ > 0.6: HIGH coherence (trustworthy signal)
- 0.3 < Cₛ ≤ 0.6: MEDIUM coherence (verify context)
- Cₛ ≤ 0.3: LOW coherence (reject or investigate)

#### Q: How does federated learning work?
**A:** Instead of sending data to a central server:
1. AI models train **locally on your device**
2. Only **encrypted model updates (gradients)** are shared
3. A secure aggregation server combines updates **without seeing individual data**
4. The improved model is sent back to all devices

Your neural patterns never leave your device.

#### Q: What attacks does ONI protect against?
**A:** ONI addresses threats across all 14 layers:
- **Signal Injection:** Malicious signals trying to influence neural activity
- **Eavesdropping:** Unauthorized reading of neural data
- **Denial of Service:** Blocking legitimate neural communication
- **Neural Ransomware:** Holding neural function hostage
- **MRI/EMI Interference:** Environmental threats
- **Replay Attacks:** Replaying recorded signals

See [ONI_LAYERS.md](../oni-framework/ONI_LAYERS.md) for complete threat model.

#### Q: Is ONI open source?
**A:** Yes. ONI is licensed under Apache 2.0:
- Free to use, modify, and distribute
- No proprietary dependencies
- Full transparency in implementation
- Community contributions welcome

---

### Ethical Questions

#### Q: How does ONI handle consent?
**A:** ONI implements a **continuous consent model** based on Lázaro-Muñoz et al. research:
- **Initial consent** before device activation
- **Ongoing consent** for significant changes
- **Granular scopes** (read, write, store, transmit)
- **Right to revoke** at any time
- **Special protections** for minors and incapacitated individuals

See [INFORMED_CONSENT_FRAMEWORK.md](INFORMED_CONSENT_FRAMEWORK.md).

#### Q: What about children and vulnerable populations?
**A:** ONI includes specific protections:
- **Minors (age 7-17):** Require both guardian consent AND child assent
- **Incapacitated adults:** Supported decision-making model
- **Transitional (age 16-17):** Increasing autonomy with guardian oversight

See [PEDIATRIC_CONSIDERATIONS.md](PEDIATRIC_CONSIDERATIONS.md).

#### Q: How do I report security vulnerabilities?
**A:** Please report security issues responsibly:
- Email: [security contact to be established]
- GitHub Security Advisories: [ONI Repository](https://github.com/qinnovates/mindloft/security)
- Do NOT disclose publicly until patched
