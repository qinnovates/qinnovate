\begin{abstract}
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are transitioning from experimental neuroscience tools to
commercially deployed medical devices, with companies including Neuralink, Synchron,
Blackrock Neurotech, and Paradromics advancing toward regulatory approval and new
entrants such as Merge Labs raising \$252M in seed funding~\cite{mergelabs2026}. Yet no security
framework exists that accounts for the unique risks of devices that read and write neural
signals. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v4.0), the industry standard for
vulnerability assessment, cannot express biological tissue damage, cognitive integrity
violations, consent boundaries, damage reversibility, or neuroplastic consequences---dimensions
critical to neural device security.

We present an integrated security framework comprising four contributions:
(1)~an \textbf{11-band hourglass architecture} mapping attack surfaces from neocortex to
wireless radio across neural, interface, and synthetic zones;
(2)~\textbf{TARA}, a threat taxonomy of 102 techniques across 15 tactics and 8 domains, each
classified by status, severity, and dual-use therapeutic potential;
(3)~\textbf{NISS}, the Neural Impact Scoring System---a CVSS v4.0 extension adding five
neural-specific metrics (Biological Impact, Cognitive Integrity, Consent Violation,
Reversibility, Neuroplasticity) designed to conform with FIRST.org's official extension mechanism; and
(4)~the \textbf{Neural Impact Chain}, a methodology mapping security vulnerabilities to
DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses through a six-stage pipeline.

Analysis of all 102 techniques reveals that 96.1\% require NISS extension metrics that CVSS
cannot express. The Neural Impact Chain maps all techniques to 15 unique DSM-5-TR diagnostic
codes across 5 psychiatric clusters, with 51 techniques posing direct diagnostic risk. The
framework identifies 77 techniques (75.5\%) with confirmed, probable, or possible therapeutic analogs,
establishing a dual-use atlas where every attack mechanism that can harm neural tissue has a
corresponding clinical application. The complete framework, threat registry, and scoring
system are released as open source under the Apache 2.0 license.
