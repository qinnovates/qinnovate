## 💡 One-Line Summary

> The original ONI model put the Neural Gateway at L8 (middle of a 14-layer stack).
> BCIs are physical hardware. They belong adjacent to OSI L1.
> Everything about the layer model needs to be rebuilt from that realization.

## 🧭 Design Principles

```
1. 🔗 Dependency-based       — each layer requires the layer below to exist
2. ➡️  Known dataflow         — only model what we can prove directionally
3. 🚫 No consciousness       — we don't model what we can't measure
4. ❓ Accommodate unknowns   — wildcard zones for future discovery
5. 🔄 Loop, not pyramid      — the brain is a cycle, not a stack
6. 📈 Evolving document      — like the Periodic Law, this will refine with time
```
