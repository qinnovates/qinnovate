We state clearly: **the quantum terms in the QI equation are theoretical constructs**. The classical coherence metric Cₛ is grounded in established signal processing; the quantum terms (Qᵢ, Q_entangle, Q_tunnel) depend on unresolved questions in quantum biology.\n\nQIF's design philosophy treats this uncertainty as a feature, not a bug. By parameterizing open questions rather than assuming answers, the framework degrades gracefully: if all quantum terms prove negligible, QIF reduces to a classical coherence-based security metric that is still novel and useful.\n\n## The Decoherence Time Debate {#sec-decoherence-debate}\n\nThe central empirical question for QIF is: **how long do quantum coherence effects persist in warm, wet neural tissue?** The answer spans over 16 orders of magnitude across the literature:\n\n::: {#tbl-decoherence-camps .cell tbl-cap='Decoherence Timescale Estimates in the Literature' execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Position</th>\n      <th>τ_D</th>\n      <th>Implication</th>\n      <th>QI at t=1μs</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Tegmark (skeptic)</td>\n      <td>10⁻¹³ s</td>\n      <td>Quantum effects impossible in biology</td>\n      <td>0.750</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Recent experimental</td>\n      <td>10⁻⁵ s</td>\n      <td>Possible microsecond quantum window</td>\n      <td>1.338</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Fisher (optimist)</td>\n      <td>Hours</td>\n      <td>Nuclear spin coherence in Posner molecules</td>\n      <td>1.400</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n**If Tegmark is correct** (τ_D ~ 10⁻¹³ s), all quantum terms vanish at any measurable timescale and QIF reduces to QI(t) ≈ α·Ĉ_class − γ·Q̂_tunnel. The classical coherence metric Cₛ remains a novel contribution to BCI security. See the Tegmark Engagement section in Chapter 6 for a detailed analysis.\n:::\n\nRecent work complicates the picture: Dewan (2026) shows that non-Markovian dynamics in finite-memory environments produce **quadratic** (not exponential) short-time decoherence, potentially extending coherence windows. Fisher et al. (2025) report the first experimental evidence consistent with Posner molecule quantum effects. Neither settles the question.\n\n## The Calibration Gap {#sec-calibration-gap}\n\nAll scaling coefficients in the QI equation are **uncalibrated placeholders**:\n\n::: {#tbl-uncalibrated .cell tbl-cap='Uncalibrated Parameters in the QI Equation' execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>param</th>\n      <th>default</th>\n      <th>status</th>\n      <th>calibration_method</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>α (classical weight)</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>Placeholder</td>\n      <td>Regression on labeled BCI security incidents</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>β (quantum weight)</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>Placeholder</td>\n      <td>Controlled decoherence experiments</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>γ (tunneling weight)</td>\n      <td>0.5</td>\n      <td>Placeholder</td>\n      <td>Ion channel patch-clamp tunneling measurements</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>δ (entanglement weight)</td>\n      <td>0.5</td>\n      <td>Placeholder</td>\n      <td>Bell test experiments on neural tissue</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUntil these parameters are calibrated against real BCI data, **all QI scores are relative, not absolute**. A QI score of 0.85 does not mean \"85% secure\" — it means \"more secure than a configuration scoring 0.70, under the same parameterization.\" The framework provides a ranking, not a measurement, until empirical calibration is achieved.\n\n## The Measurement Problem\n\nCandidate 2 (the tensor-product form) requires quantum state tomography of neural tissue — a measurement that has never been performed on living brain. This is not a minor technical gap; it may require technologies that do not yet exist.\n\nCandidate 1 (the additive form) was designed to be more empirically accessible. Each term can in principle be estimated from:\n\n- **Ĉ_class**: Standard EEG/ECoG signal processing (established)\n- **Q̂_i**: Estimated from decoherence models (theoretical)\n- **Q̂_entangle**: Estimated from Bell-type correlation measurements (speculative for neural tissue)\n- **Q̂_tunnel**: Estimated from ion channel conductance measurements (partially established)\n\nEven for Candidate 1, the quantum terms remain theoretical until experimental protocols are developed and validated.\n\n## Scope Limitations\n\n::: {#cell-scope-limits .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {#scope-limits .cell-output .cell-output-display .cell-output-markdown execution_count=4}\n- QIF targets implanted BCIs (intracortical, ECoG). Non-invasive EEG BCIs have fundamentally different interface physics.\n- The quantum adversary timeline depends on fault-tolerant quantum computing, estimated 2030-2040+ (Gidney 2025).\n- QIF assumes electrode-tissue interface physics; next-gen optical or magnetogenetic interfaces may require different models.\n- Clinical validation requires IRB approval, neurosurgical collaboration, and access to implanted BCI patients.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## AI-Assisted Research Transparency {#sec-ai-transparency}\n\n::: {#cell-ai-disclosure .cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {#ai-disclosure .cell-output .cell-output-display .cell-output-markdown execution_count=5}\n\nThis framework was developed with significant AI assistance: **Claude (Opus 4.5)** (Co-derivation, implementation, research agent orchestration), **Gemini 2.5** (Independent peer review (cross-AI validation)).\n\nThe complete audit trail of every derivation, AI contribution, human decision, and validation result\nis recorded in [QIF-DERIVATION-LOG.md](QIF-DERIVATION-LOG.md) with timestamps.\nAll research sources are cataloged in [QIF-RESEARCH-SOURCES.md](QIF-RESEARCH-SOURCES.md).\n\n**What AI did:** Literature synthesis, equation derivation assistance, code implementation, cross-validation between domains, independent peer review (Gemini).\n\n**What AI did NOT do:** Make framework decisions, choose between competing hypotheses, or determine what to publish. All architectural decisions (e.g., v3.1 hourglass, dropping N4, choosing QIF over ONI) were made by Kevin Qi.\n\nThis transparency is itself a novel contribution — few frameworks in any field provide this level of AI-collaboration documentation.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Open Questions as Research Roadmap {#sec-open-questions}\n\nRather than treating unknowns as weaknesses, QIF maps them as a research roadmap. Each open question corresponds to a tunable parameter:\n\n::: {#tbl-open-questions .cell tbl-cap='Eight Open Questions Mapped to QIF Parameters' execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>question</th>\n      <th>param</th>\n      <th>range</th>\n      <th>resolution</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>What is τ_D for neural microtubules in vivo?</td>\n      <td>τ_D</td>\n      <td>10⁻²⁰ to 10³·⁶ s</td>\n      <td>Ultrafast spectroscopy on living brain tissue</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Are ion channel tunneling profiles unique per ...</td>\n      <td>Q_tunnel</td>\n      <td>Unknown</td>\n      <td>Single-channel patch clamp + quantum state tom...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Does BCI sampling rate affect quantum coherenc...</td>\n      <td>Zeno gate</td>\n      <td>Unknown</td>\n      <td>Vary sampling rate, measure coherence time</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Can Davydov solitons trigger false synaptic ev...</td>\n      <td>Q_tunnel</td>\n      <td>Unknown</td>\n      <td>THz stimulation of SNARE complexes in vitro</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>What is the Hilbert space dimension d for neur...</td>\n      <td>Q̂_i norm</td>\n      <td>2 to ~10⁶</td>\n      <td>Quantum state tomography of microtubule states</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>Are Posner molecules present in human cortex?</td>\n      <td>Fisher τ_D</td>\n      <td>Hours if yes</td>\n      <td>³¹P NMR spectroscopy of cortical tissue</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>What is the entanglement entropy of neural Bel...</td>\n      <td>Q_entangle</td>\n      <td>0 to ln(d)</td>\n      <td>Loophole-free Bell test on neural preparations</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>Does non-Markovian decoherence extend coherenc...</td>\n      <td>Γ_D(t) form</td>\n      <td>Quadratic vs exp</td>\n      <td>Time-resolved coherence measurements in warm w...</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nResolving any single question narrows the parameter space and increases the framework's predictive power. The questions are ordered roughly by experimental accessibility — the first (decoherence timescale) is the most impactful and most feasible to address with current technology.\n\n",
