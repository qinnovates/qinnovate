## The Speculative Nature of Quantum Neural Security

This framework operates at the intersection of quantum physics, neuroscience, and cybersecurity — three fields whose overlap is largely unexplored experimentally. We state clearly: **the quantum terms in the QI equation are theoretical constructs**. The classical coherence metric Cₛ is grounded in established signal processing; the quantum terms (Qᵢ, Q_entangle, Q_tunnel) depend on unresolved questions in quantum biology.

QIF's design philosophy treats this uncertainty as a feature, not a bug. By parameterizing open questions rather than assuming answers, the framework degrades gracefully: if all quantum terms prove negligible, QIF reduces to a classical coherence-based security metric that is still novel and useful.

## The Decoherence Time Debate {#sec-decoherence-debate}

The central empirical question for QIF is: **how long do quantum coherence effects persist in warm, wet neural tissue?** The answer spans over 16 orders of magnitude across the literature:

```{python}
#| label: tbl-decoherence-camps
#| tbl-cap: "Decoherence Timescale Estimates in the Literature"

rows = []
for camp in DECOHERENCE_CAMPS:
    params = QICandidate1Params(tau_d=camp['tau_d'])
    qi_at_1us = qi_candidate1(c_class=0.8, qi_indeterminacy=0.5, q_entangle=0.3, q_tunnel=0.1, t=1e-6, params=params)
    rows.append({
        'Position': camp['camp'],
        'τ_D': camp['label'],
        'Implication': camp['implication'],
        'QI at t=1μs': f'{qi_at_1us:.3f}',
    })
pd.DataFrame(rows)
```

::: {.callout-important}
**If Tegmark is correct** (τ_D ~ 10⁻¹³ s), all quantum terms vanish at any measurable timescale and QIF reduces to QI(t) ≈ α·Ĉ_class − γ·Q̂_tunnel. The classical coherence metric Cₛ remains a novel contribution to BCI security. See the Tegmark Engagement section in Chapter 6 for a detailed analysis.

Recent work complicates the picture: Dewan (2026) shows that non-Markovian dynamics in finite-memory environments produce **quadratic** (not exponential) short-time decoherence, potentially extending coherence windows. Fisher et al. (2025) report the first experimental evidence consistent with Posner molecule quantum effects. Neither settles the question.

## The Calibration Gap {#sec-calibration-gap}

All scaling coefficients in the QI equation are **uncalibrated placeholders**:

```{python}
#| label: tbl-uncalibrated
#| tbl-cap: "Uncalibrated Parameters in the QI Equation"

pd.DataFrame(UNCALIBRATED_PARAMS)
```

Until these parameters are calibrated against real BCI data, **all QI scores are relative, not absolute**. A QI score of 0.85 does not mean "85% secure" — it means "more secure than a configuration scoring 0.70, under the same parameterization." The framework provides a ranking, not a measurement, until empirical calibration is achieved.

## The Measurement Problem

Candidate 2 (the tensor-product form) requires quantum state tomography of neural tissue — a measurement that has never been performed on living brain. This is not a minor technical gap; it may require technologies that do not yet exist.

Candidate 1 (the additive form) was designed to be more empirically accessible. Each term can in principle be estimated from:

- **Ĉ_class**: Standard EEG/ECoG signal processing (established)
- **Q̂_i**: Estimated from decoherence models (theoretical)
- **Q̂_entangle**: Estimated from Bell-type correlation measurements (speculative for neural tissue)
- **Q̂_tunnel**: Estimated from ion channel conductance measurements (partially established)

Even for Candidate 1, the quantum terms remain theoretical until experimental protocols are developed and validated.

## Scope Limitations

```{python}
#| label: scope-limits

from IPython.display import Markdown

bullets = "\n".join(f"- {s}" for s in SCOPE_LIMITATIONS)

```

### Interface Extensibility

The I0 band is not wedded to electrodes. As BCI technology evolves, the same hourglass architecture applies — only the physics at the bottleneck changes:

```{python}
#| label: tbl-interface-types
#| tbl-cap: "How QIF's I0 Band Adapts to Different Interface Technologies"

pd.DataFrame(INTERFACE_TYPES)[['type', 'i0_physics', 'quantum_mechanism', 'examples', 'status']]
```

## AI-Assisted Research Transparency {#sec-ai-transparency}

```{python}
#| label: ai-disclosure

from IPython.display import Markdown

ai = FRAMEWORK['ai_transparency']
systems = ", ".join(f"**{s['name']}** ({s['role']})" for s in ai['ai_systems'])
Markdown(f"""
This framework was developed with significant AI assistance: {systems}.

The complete audit trail of every derivation, AI contribution, human decision, and validation result
is recorded in [{ai['audit_trail']}]({ai['audit_trail']}) with timestamps.
All research sources are cataloged in [{ai['research_sources']}]({ai['research_sources']}).

**What AI did:** Literature synthesis, equation derivation assistance, code implementation, cross-validation between domains, independent peer review (Gemini).

**What AI did NOT do:** Make framework decisions, choose between competing hypotheses, or determine what to publish. All architectural decisions (e.g., v3.1 hourglass, dropping N4, choosing QIF over ONI) were made by Kevin Qi.

This transparency is itself a novel contribution — few frameworks in any field provide this level of AI-collaboration documentation.

## Open Questions as Research Roadmap {#sec-open-questions}

Rather than treating unknowns as weaknesses, QIF maps them as a research roadmap. Each open question corresponds to a tunable parameter:

```{python}
#| label: tbl-open-questions
#| tbl-cap: "Eight Open Questions Mapped to QIF Parameters"

pd.DataFrame(OPEN_QUESTIONS)
```

Resolving any single question narrows the parameter space and increases the framework's predictive power. The questions are ordered roughly by experimental accessibility — the first (decoherence timescale) is the most impactful and most feasible to address with current technology.
