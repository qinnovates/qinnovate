## What This Is

A ground-up architectural redesign of BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) security, built from neuroscience constraints rather than retrofitted IT models. This is the Quantum Model — the active research framework that complements the [Classical Model (ONI)](../oni-framework/).

The original ONI Framework put the Neural Gateway at Layer 8 (middle of a 14-layer stack). BCIs are physical hardware — they belong adjacent to OSI Layer 1. Everything needed to be rebuilt from that realization.

## The Framework (9 documents)

| # | Document | What It Covers |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 01 | [WHY-REVAMP](framework/01-WHY-REVAMP.md) | Why the original model was fundamentally flawed |
| 02 | [KNOWNS-AND-UNKNOWNS](framework/02-KNOWNS-AND-UNKNOWNS.md) | What neuroscience has confirmed vs. what remains open |
| 03 | [BCI-CAPABILITIES](framework/03-BCI-CAPABILITIES.md) | Every proven BCI READ/WRITE/CLOSED-LOOP today |
| 04 | [FRAMEWORKS-ANALYSIS](framework/04-FRAMEWORKS-ANALYSIS.md) | OSI, Kandel, biological organization — the math and patterns |
| 05 | [PROPOSED-MODEL](framework/05-PROPOSED-MODEL.md) | The funnel model and quantum tunneling thought experiment |
| 06 | [GAP-ANALYSIS](framework/06-GAP-ANALYSIS.md) | Known limits vs. open questions |
| 07 | [QUANTUM-BIOLOGY](framework/07-QUANTUM-BIOLOGY.md) | What's proven, what's not, and the measurement wall |
| 08 | [QUANTUM-INTEGER](framework/08-QUANTUM-INTEGER.md) | Q — the labeled gap for quantum unknowns at each ring |
| 09 | [QUANTUM-NEUROSECURITY](framework/09-QUANTUM-NEUROSECURITY.md) | Quantum bridges, DSKE, defense-in-depth rings, NIST CSF lifecycle |

**Read in order.** Each document builds on the previous.

## Governance (Neuroethics First)

> The foundation isn't faster tools. It's defining the rules those tools must follow.
> Neuroethics bridges the Classical and Quantum models — without it, both risk enabling the very threats they aim to prevent.

| Document | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| [TRANSPARENCY](../governance/TRANSPARENCY.md) | Human-AI collaboration audit trail |
| [NEUROSECURITY_GOVERNANCE](../governance/NEUROSECURITY_GOVERNANCE.md) | Unified: neuroethics alignment, UNESCO alignment, regulatory compliance, GRC gaps, convergence strategy |
| [POLICY_PROPOSAL](../governance/NEUROSECURITY_POLICY_PROPOSAL.md) | Policy recommendations: six asks for six organizations, phased timeline, QIF as reference implementation |
| [INFORMED_CONSENT](../governance/INFORMED_CONSENT_FRAMEWORK.md) | Consent requirements + pediatric & incapacity (Lazaro-Munoz framework) |
| [POST_DEPLOYMENT](../governance/POST_DEPLOYMENT_ETHICS.md) | Device lifecycle and abandonment prevention |
| [DATA_POLICY](../governance/DATA_POLICY_FAQ.md) | Privacy FAQ and user rights |
| [ACCESSIBILITY](../governance/ACCESSIBILITY.md) | Accessibility standards and compliance |

## Key Concepts

- **The Funnel Model** — Biology narrows to a neck (BCI), then widens into synthetic systems. Not a stack — a cycle.
- **11-Band Hourglass (v4.0)** — N7-N1 | I0 | S1-S3 (7 neural bands, 1 interface, 3 synthetic bands)
- **Quantum Integer (Q)** — A labeled gap for quantum unknowns at each ring. Like Mendeleev's empty boxes.
- **Defense-in-Depth Rings** — 7 concentric security rings from governance (outer) to neural data (core).
- **DSKE** — Distributed Symmetric Key Establishment: quantum-safe encryption without quantum hardware at the implant.
- **NIST CSF Lifecycle** — Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover — mapped to the funnel diagram.

## Two Models, One Mission

| | Classical | Quantum |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework** | ONI 14-Layer Model | QIF 7-Band Hourglass |
| **Focus** | Securing today | Securing tomorrow |
| **Foundation** | OSI extension into biology | Quantum physics at neural boundary |
| **Status** | Established | Active research |
| **Bridge** | ← Neuroethics & Security by Design → |

## Evolution

This framework evolved from the original ONI (Open Neurosecurity Interoperability) research. The foundational publications, Python packages, and earlier analysis are preserved in [`legacy-core/`](../legacy-core/).
