# About — Kevin Qi

I'm **Kevin Qi**, a security engineer and neurosecurity researcher. I started this project with a question that keeps me up at night: *what happens to a patient when their brain-computer interface gets hacked?*

Not what happens to the data. Not what happens to the device. What happens to the *mind*. I couldn't find a framework that answered that question, so I built one. This is the OSI of Mind.

That question didn't come from a textbook. It came from my own brain feeling hijacked. A B12 deficiency damaged my nervous system. I couldn't walk for weeks. My hands were uncontrollable. I didn't feel like myself. Once you've felt your own nervous system seize up on you, the idea of plugging a machine into that system hits different.

## The Precedent

In the 1970s, computer networks were fragmented — every manufacturer had its own proprietary system, and none of them could talk to each other. Charles Bachman provided the architectural vision that broke the deadlock: 7 layers, flexible enough to encompass every competing approach. That became the OSI model — the foundation the entire internet is built on.

They didn't wait until networking was "figured out." They built the framework while the technology was still evolving, and it shaped everything that followed. QIF follows the same principle.

## The Discovery

In Istanbul, I met Ali, an Airbnb host who was like a sagacious captain straight out of *Moby Dick* — the kind of man who had traveled the world and carried its stories in his eyes. When he mentioned one of the oldest bookstores in the city and saw the spark in my eyes, he didn't just point me there. He came with me. And when I lost myself in the stacks — pulling atlases, flipping through century-old pages — he waited. Two hours. Or maybe it was three. No rush, no judgment. Just presence.

Inside, I discovered a copy of *The Development of the Periodic Law*, published in 1896 by F.P. Venable, Ph.D. It documented how the periodic table went through dozens of visual representations — circles, spirals, waves, towers — before arriving at the rectangular grid even children explore today. Mendeleev didn't just organize what was known — he left gaps for what wasn't. Those gaps predicted elements that were later discovered.

I carried an entire stack of books through Istanbul, to Morocco, and back home — guarding them like treasures. That journey fueled something in me: a hunger for yesterday to act as the foundation for tomorrow.

Like the OSI model and the periodic table, QIF is a living framework: organizing what we know, highlighting what we don't, evolving as discovery fills in the gaps.

## Why Neuroethics

Neuroethics and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand. Cybersecurity is about understanding human psychology and behavior, and creating guardrails and defense mechanisms to prevent sensitive information from leaking, preventing the preventable by understanding behaviors from both the offensive and defensive sides. All to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This is the core of security, what the industry calls the CIA triad. *(Sounds so weird being Chinese American and saying "CIA triad," by the way.)* Ethics is ingrained at its core. Neuroethics is about understanding what keeps us all unique — what makes us, us. There's a lot more overlap than most people suspect. When you extend that trifecta to the brain, to a system where "availability" means a patient's ability to think, "integrity" means the authenticity of their own thoughts, and "confidentiality" means the privacy of their inner experience — you're doing neuroethics whether you call it that or not.

## The Framework

Qinnovate's Neural Atlas bridges three domains, two that share deep roots, and a third that has rarely been at the table:

- **Cybersecurity** — Layered defense models, threat taxonomies, attack surface analysis, and vulnerability scoring
- **Cognitive Neuroscience** — Neuroanatomy, neural signaling pathways, clinical outcomes, and the DSM-5-TR diagnostic framework
- **Neuroethics** — Neurorights frameworks, informed consent in neural contexts, cognitive liberty, and the governance of technologies that interface with the mind

The result is the **Hourglass Model**: an 11-band, 3-zone architecture with the Neural Interface (I0 — the physical BCI device) at its waist. Biology above. Silicon below. The [TARA Atlas](https://qinnovate.com/TARA/) maps 102 techniques across this hierarchy, each scored with NISS and traced to clinical outcomes through the Neural Impact Chain.

The framework includes [governance documents](governance/) mapping technical controls to neuroethics principles, the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Neurotechnology (2025), and regulatory requirements across US federal, state, and international jurisdictions.

A mentor once taught me: we don't give answers to other people's ponders. We give guidance. A framework. One that is simple yet answers itself as time moves on. One that works with or without us.

That is the goal of Qinnovate.

## Why This Is My Purpose

This is my sole purpose. I spent the past three years thinking about this. I had amazing offers at amazing companies spanning tech and AI, yet I subconsciously couldn't allow myself to go through with them fully. I spent three years digging into my core identity, trying to understand what moves the compass that builds my sense of self. I went through exploring and re-learning all the disciplines I enjoyed through my entire life and more.

I've only wanted one thing in life, and that's to help save lives. I am not built for a doctor. I can't even watch myself give blood without feeling like passing out. When I generated the brain model rendering on the [neurogovernance page](https://qinnovate.com/neurogovernance/), I couldn't stand the realistic-looking human brain I initially had on there. It gave me the heebie-jeebies. What I do know is that science, psychology, and technology have always been my interests, and this work sits at the intersection of it all.

As Neil deGrasse Tyson said, the most dangerous thing is not knowing you're wrong because you simply don't know enough. Insight is the teacher of wonder, not experience. I cannot get insight simply by learning; it is by doing. Putting action to experience, and then learning from it. I eventually laid everything out, I mapped how to get there, and this is my first leap.

## The Path Here

**Science** started with my first book. I asked my parents to buy it in 1999 or 2000. I saw the ad for it in a magazine. It was $19.99\*. And then in small text at the bottom of the page, in yellow or beige, it said "\*10 monthly payments." Not even joking. Horrible. That's what we now call a [dark pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern), a term that wouldn't be coined until 2010 by Harry Brignull. My family experienced it a decade before anyone had a word for it. I didn't know what payments were. We only found out months later when my parents saw the charges. My parents couldn't read English; they just thought, "Oh, this kid likes planets and space — $19.99, why not?"

**Psychology** has always been an interest because I always felt different. I wanted to know myself. I wanted to understand why I thought the way I did. I didn't know that it would be so useful, and I'm regretting that I didn't take that one lab to get a double major. It's never too late though.

**Technology** — I fell in love with it when my mom bought me Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. Talk about gamified learning. I wanted to buy Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego and remember being there at a bookstore, might've been Barnes & Noble. I saw the game and she said, "You'll need to learn how to type first... It'll be very useful one day." She said I could only play if I spent time every weekend playing Mavis Beacon first. Thank you, Mom. Now I can't stop typing.

After we got our first family computer, a Hewlett-Packard, that's when I discovered the good and bad of the internet. I saw some things a kid shouldn't have. I got in trouble. It was not good for a kid at that time, but hey, it taught me how to cope with shame and mistakes. We just need to own them in order to really learn the redeeming values that they teach us. Mistakes are what make us all human.

Would it have been nice to see knights and castles when I went to middleages.com? Yes, absolutely. That was a search engine error by either AltaVista or AskJeeves. (Yes, pre-Google for you youngins calling me unc reading this!) It was for a school project about the medieval times. It was the wild wild west back then, and honestly, it's relatively recent in the grand scheme of it.

That was before the regulations were all put in place to require categorizations for all websites. Oh wait, that's just some corporate firewalls that cared about security. That's how I ensured the environments I was safeguarding blocked malicious pages and code by fingerprinting them and using witchcraft and magic behind the scenes to sandbox and stop potential zero-days, even. I can't believe I managed the security infrastructure for over 200 firewalls at one point, but Palo Alto made it easy. Now AWS and Azure make it even easier and it can all be deployed with lines of code. No need to waste time in a UI. So convenient once you get the hang of it. (Shoutout to my old coworker who taught me this!)

That's all old tech now, by the way. The industry has moved to zero-trust and perimeterless architectures. No more castle-and-moat. Kind of like how we can communicate wirelessly now and don't need a telephone cable connecting our minds. Thankfully. But I wonder how this will all change with [MIT's AlterEgo](https://news.mit.edu/2018/computer-system-transcribes-words-users-speak-silently-0404) and subvocalization, allowing people to communicate silently, except not really fully in the sense of the word "telepathic" because it's still just signals our brains interpret that can be baselined from muscle movement and electrical pulses. I'm sure Apple's working on something similar for Siri. Why else would they have a [patent for EEG-enabled AirPods](https://qinnovate.com/publications/2026-02-07-apple-just-made-brain-control-a-native-input-method-now-what/) now?

An old manager and mentor once shared an important statement when he handed the reins of all the corporate firewalls to me to harden and safeguard: security is not about being internet police. I told this to my team whenever they required certain access for security purposes to handle incidents and triage malware. Trust but verify. I always enabled logging, especially out of a healthy fear of insider threat. It's good to instill trust, but also good to be a little paranoid for this career path.

I don't think normal everyday people should ever have to feel unsafe when they browse a website. There's nothing more traumatizing than when your AOL starts making terrifying screaming sounds at night (probably some background process from a popup) while you're trying to design in the dark so your parents don't know you're on the computer at 5 AM on a school day. I promise I was being productive. And yes, I seriously was designing in Photoshop prior to CS days. No pun(s) intended.

That game led me to building my first website at 11 or 12. It was called AGFX, a phpBB board that I co-created with a friend I met on a game called RuneScape. Aaron was a little older than I was and knew much more about web design, so he spun up the servers and showed me how it worked, how to maintain it. Our goal? Make as many tutorials as possible and submit them online to get members. It worked, we had about 3,000 members at one point. Who knew it would lead me to this path here, now. He eventually went to college and I went to high school. Life got busy. You know, girls, and trying to lose all the baby fat from sitting playing games all day while creating free forum signatures and avatars for community members.

I remember making a bunch of tutorials for Photoshop, one specifically being featured on Top100PhotoshopTutorials.com (for those who know about it, this precedes DeviantArt). I was astounded that my 13-year-old self was able to get a feature simply for trying to find an easier way to create a moon without using so many layers and brushstrokes that other tutorials asked for. Ironically, I eventually went on to making digital abstract art for wallpapers, backgrounds, and forum members who requested them from me from AGFX and the Zybez community *(wow, I just remembered I was a moderator... isn't that child labor, hah!)*, all for fun, using nothing but layers, brushes, and vectors. Oh, and a lot of blending options. People seemed to like my design.

## What I Found

There's still so much more I have yet to unpack, and it's only more exciting with each day. So much so that it's nearly 5 AM and I don't want to sleep... again.

The importance of having an open framework is that just in the past month, I was able to map out more and more simply by using what I could find and what my AI agents (predominantly Claude) could help me digest from academia. It may not be 100% accurate, and that's exactly why I need more peer review of this work: to ensure we have something that is fundamental to not just our safety, but also our health. This is why neuroethics needs more engineers, to help tackle these problems from a different lens.

## Vision

Normal users of the internet shouldn't have to worry about visiting a website and accidentally having a man-in-the-middle deliver ransomware to their computer. That should be left to the professionals, and yet the tools we built to create what we call the modern internet are still relics of an era that didn't anticipate the threats we face today. The future state has so much room for improvement.

Brain-computer interfaces represent a fresh slate. It's not often that society arrives at a truly pivotal moment in technology — a chance to build something right from the beginning, rather than retrofitting security onto a system that was never designed for it. To me, BCIs are that digital leap: a chance to ensure that the next generation of human-computer interaction is secure by design, not by afterthought. And ensuring we still remain the definition of human at our core. That's where neuroethics comes in.

I'm glad the days of browser pop-ups are no longer a major concern. But the next frontier is adversaries looking to fingerprint our actual thoughts. The future I envision is one that is achievable, and this is the work that gets us there, collectively.

## Collaborate

This is a conversation I cannot have alone. I'm looking for academics, researchers, and neuroscientists to refine QIF and establish ethical guidelines for where technology should and shouldn't intervene, for medical and safety reasons. There are unknowns in neuroscience today, and that frontier is being challenged every day. The gaps are the research agenda.

If you work with electrodes, patient data, BCI signal processing, neuroethics, or security architecture, I'd like to hear from you.
