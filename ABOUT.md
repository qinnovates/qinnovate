# About — Kevin Qi

I'm **Kevin Qi**, a security engineer and neurosecurity researcher. I started this project with a question that keeps me up at night: *what happens to a patient when their brain-computer interface gets hacked?*

Not what happens to the data. Not what happens to the device. What happens to the *mind*. I couldn't find a framework that answered that question, so I built one. This is the OSI of Mind.

That question didn't come from a textbook. It came from my own brain feeling hijacked. A B12 deficiency damaged my nervous system. I couldn't walk for weeks. My hands were uncontrollable. I didn't feel like myself. Once you've felt your own nervous system seize up on you, the idea of plugging a machine into that system hits different.

## Why Neuroethics

Neuroethics and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand. Cybersecurity is about understanding human psychology and behavior, and creating guardrails and defense mechanisms to prevent sensitive information from leaking, preventing the preventable by understanding behaviors from both the offensive and defensive sides. All to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This is the core of security, what the industry calls the CIA triad. *(Sounds so weird being Chinese American and saying "CIA triad," by the way.)* Ethics is ingrained at its core. Neuroethics is about understanding what keeps us all unique — what makes us, us. There's a lot more overlap than most people suspect. When you extend that trifecta to the brain, to a system where "availability" means a patient's ability to think, "integrity" means the authenticity of their own thoughts, and "confidentiality" means the privacy of their inner experience — you're doing neuroethics whether you call it that or not.

## The Framework

Qinnovate's Neural Atlas bridges three domains, two that share deep roots, and a third that has rarely been at the table:

- **Cybersecurity** — Layered defense models, threat taxonomies, attack surface analysis, and vulnerability scoring
- **Cognitive Neuroscience** — Neuroanatomy, neural signaling pathways, clinical outcomes, and the DSM-5-TR diagnostic framework
- **Neuroethics** — Neurorights frameworks, informed consent in neural contexts, cognitive liberty, and the governance of technologies that interface with the mind

The result is the **Hourglass Model**: an 11-band, 3-zone architecture with the Neural Interface (I0 — the physical BCI device) at its waist. Biology above. Silicon below. The [TARA Atlas](https://qinnovate.com/TARA/) maps 102 techniques across this hierarchy, each scored with NISS and traced to clinical outcomes through the Neural Impact Chain.

The framework includes [governance documents](governance/) mapping technical controls to neuroethics principles, the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Neurotechnology (2025), and regulatory requirements across US federal, state, and international jurisdictions.

A mentor once taught me: we don't give answers to other people's ponders. We give guidance. A framework. One that is simple yet answers itself as time moves on. One that works with or without us.

That is the goal of Qinnovate.

## Why This Is My Purpose

This is my sole purpose. I spent the past three years thinking about this. I had amazing offers at amazing companies spanning tech and AI, yet I subconsciously couldn't allow myself to go through with them fully. I spent three years digging into my core identity, trying to understand what moves the compass that builds my sense of self. I went through exploring and re-learning all the disciplines I enjoyed through my entire life and more.

I've only wanted one thing in life, and that's to help save lives. I am not built for a doctor. I can't even watch myself give blood without feeling like passing out. When I generated the brain model rendering on the [neurogovernance page](https://qinnovate.com/neurogovernance/), I couldn't stand the realistic-looking human brain I initially had on there. It gave me the heebie-jeebies. What I do know is that science, psychology, and technology have always been my interests, and this work sits at the intersection of it all.

As Neil deGrasse Tyson said, the most dangerous thing is not knowing you're wrong because you simply don't know enough. Insight is the teacher of wonder, not experience. I cannot get insight simply by learning; it is by doing. Putting action to experience, and then learning from it. I eventually laid everything out, I mapped how to get there, and this is my first leap.

## The Path Here

**Science** started with my first book. I asked my parents to buy it in 1999 or 2000. I saw the ad for it in a magazine. It was $19.99\*. And then in small text at the bottom of the page, in yellow or beige, it said "\*10 monthly payments." Not even joking. Horrible. That's what we now call a [dark pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern), a term that wouldn't be coined until 2010 by Harry Brignull. My family experienced it a decade before anyone had a word for it. I didn't know what payments were. We only found out months later when my parents saw the charges. My parents couldn't read English; they just thought, "Oh, this kid likes planets and space — $19.99, why not?"

**Psychology** has always been an interest because I always felt different. I wanted to know myself. I wanted to understand why I thought the way I did. I didn't know that it would be so useful, and I'm regretting that I didn't take that one lab to get a double major. It's never too late though.

**Technology** — I fell in love with it when my mom bought me Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. Talk about gamified learning. I wanted to buy Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego and remember being there at a bookstore, might've been Barnes & Noble. I saw the game and she said, "You'll need to learn how to type first... It'll be very useful one day." She said I could only play if I spent time every weekend playing Mavis Beacon first. Thank you, Mom. Now I can't stop typing.

After we got our first family computer, a Hewlett-Packard, that's when I discovered the good and bad of the internet. I saw some things a kid shouldn't have. I got in trouble. It was not good for a kid at that time, but hey, it taught me how to cope with shame and mistakes. We just need to own them in order to really learn the redeeming values that they teach us. Mistakes are what make us all human.

Would it have been nice to see knights and castles when I went to middleages.com? Yes, absolutely. That was a search engine error by either AltaVista or AskJeeves. (Yes, pre-Google for you youngins calling me unc reading this!) It was for a school project about the medieval times. It was the wild wild west back then, and honestly, it's relatively recent in the grand scheme of it.

That was before the regulations were all put in place to require categorizations for all websites. Oh wait, that's just some corporate firewalls that cared about security. That's how I ensured the environments I was safeguarding blocked malicious pages and code by fingerprinting them and using witchcraft and magic behind the scenes to sandbox and stop potential zero-days, even. I can't believe I managed the security infrastructure for over 200 firewalls at one point, but Palo Alto made it easy. Now AWS and Azure make it even easier and it can all be deployed with lines of code. No need to waste time in a UI. So convenient once you get the hang of it. (Shoutout to my old coworker who taught me this!)

That's all old tech now, by the way. The industry has moved to zero-trust and perimeterless architectures. No more castle-and-moat. Kind of like how we can communicate wirelessly now and don't need a telephone cable connecting our minds. Thankfully. But I wonder how this will all change with [MIT's AlterEgo](https://news.mit.edu/2018/computer-system-transcribes-words-users-speak-silently-0404) and subvocalization, allowing people to communicate silently, except not really fully in the sense of the word "telepathic" because it's still just signals our brains interpret that can be baselined from muscle movement and electrical pulses. I'm sure Apple's working on something similar for Siri. Why else would they have a [patent for EEG-enabled AirPods](https://qinnovate.com/publications/2026-02-07-apple-just-made-brain-control-a-native-input-method-now-what/) now?

An old manager and mentor once shared an important statement when he handed the reins of all the corporate firewalls to me to harden and safeguard: security is not about being internet police. I told this to my team whenever they required certain access for security purposes to handle incidents and triage malware. Trust but verify. I always enabled logging, especially out of a healthy fear of insider threat. It's good to instill trust, but also good to be a little paranoid for this career path.

I don't think normal everyday people should ever have to feel unsafe when they browse a website. There's nothing more traumatizing than when your AOL starts making terrifying screaming sounds at night (probably some background process from a popup) while you're trying to design in the dark so your parents don't know you're on the computer at 5 AM on a school day. I promise I was being productive. And yes, I seriously was designing in Photoshop prior to CS days. No pun(s) intended.

That game led me to building my first website at 11 or 12. It was called AGFX, a phpBB board that I co-created with a friend I met on a game called RuneScape. Aaron was a little older than I was and knew much more about web design, so he spun up the servers and showed me how it worked, how to maintain it. Our goal? Make as many tutorials as possible and submit them online to get members. It worked, we had about 3,000 members at one point. Who knew it would lead me to this path here, now. He eventually went to college and I went to high school. Life got busy. You know, girls, and trying to lose all the baby fat from sitting playing games all day while creating free forum signatures and avatars for community members.

I remember making a bunch of tutorials for Photoshop, one specifically being featured on Top100PhotoshopTutorials.com (for those who know about it, this precedes DeviantArt). I was astounded that my 13-year-old self was able to get a feature simply for trying to find an easier way to create a moon without using so many layers and brushstrokes that other tutorials asked for. Ironically, I eventually went on to making digital abstract art for wallpapers, backgrounds, and forum members who requested them from me from AGFX and the Zybez community *(wow, I just remembered I was a moderator... isn't that child labor, hah!)*, all for fun, using nothing but layers, brushes, and vectors. Oh, and a lot of blending options. People seemed to like my design.

## Why the Hourglass Looks the Way It Does

In the 1970s, computer networks were fragmented — every manufacturer had its own proprietary system, and none of them could talk to each other. Charles Bachman provided the architectural vision that broke the deadlock: 7 layers, flexible enough to encompass every competing approach. That became the OSI model — the foundation the entire internet is built on. They didn't wait until networking was "figured out." They built the framework while the technology was still evolving, and it shaped everything that followed. QIF follows the same principle.

I am aware that the QIF layers will evolve and change over time. This is only my iteration based on what I know, and I don't know nearly enough. But what I do know is that I was inspired by a book I picked up while browsing an old bookstore in Istanbul: *The Development of the Periodic Law* by [Francis Preston Venable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Preston_Venable), a chemist and president of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, published in 1896. Ironically, a book from the States found halfway around the world. (Hey UNC — if you're reading and interested in the copy, I'd be more than happy to donate it for record keeping if you don't have one. It's not in the best condition, but a book from 1896 is a fascinating part of history that deserves to be preserved.)

In Istanbul, I met Ali, an Airbnb host who was like a sagacious captain straight out of *Moby Dick* — the kind of man who had traveled the world and carried its stories in his eyes. When he mentioned one of the oldest bookstores in the city and saw the spark in my eyes, he didn't just point me there. He came with me. And when I lost myself in the stacks — pulling atlases, flipping through century-old pages — he waited. Two hours. Or maybe it was three. No rush, no judgment. Just presence. Inside, I discovered that copy of Venable's book. It documented how the periodic table went through dozens of visual representations — circles, spirals, waves, towers — before arriving at the rectangular grid even children explore today. Mendeleev didn't just organize what was known — he left gaps for what wasn't. Those gaps predicted elements that were later discovered. I carried an entire stack of books through Istanbul, to Morocco, and back home — guarding them like treasures. That journey fueled something in me: a hunger for yesterday to act as the foundation for tomorrow. Like the OSI model and the periodic table, QIF is a living framework: organizing what we know, highlighting what we don't, evolving as discovery fills in the gaps.

> *"The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it."*
> — Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* 4.3

What I took away from that book is that it took many, many iterations to get to the periodic table we know today, one that middle schoolers can read. Dozens of scientists proposed competing arrangements before Mendeleev's version stuck, and even his went through revisions. That's what inspired me to start by finding the smallest layers to map out technology and the mind: the least common denominators, a Venn diagram bridging the two worlds, what I call "The OSI of Mind." The fewest yet most effective layers, grounded on the principles of science, something Isaac Newton understood long before I can imagine. I always forget how much of a genius that man was for inventing my biggest kryptonite: calculus. I didn't see any need for it before, but now it's all making sense: why it's important for waves and electromagnetism. Actually, I think that was Maxwell who built on Newton's work. The point is: the foundations compound. Each layer of understanding enables the next, and the hourglass is designed with that same philosophy.

## What I Found

I started by cataloguing every known BCI attack technique I could find: 60 at first, merged and deduplicated from three separate inventories: QIF's 18 attacks, ONI's 24 legacy techniques (ONI was my original design with 14 layers before landing on QIF, you can find it if you browse through GitHub), and 20+ new attack types from 2024–2026 research. Then I asked a different question: *what do computers and neurons actually have in common?* The answer was physics: signal frequencies. Signals operating at different scales, from raw electromagnetic fields up through cortical oscillations. That insight became QIF's (pronounced "Chief") layered architecture, and when I mapped those 60 techniques across the frequency bands, gaps appeared everywhere. Entire attack surfaces that existing taxonomies had missed. The catalogue grew to 102.

I traced each technique through the neural pathways it disrupts, the cognitive functions it impairs, and the psychiatric outcomes it can produce. I initially tried to map everything to CVSS, the industry standard for scoring vulnerabilities. It didn't make sense. These are two entirely different systems, and CVSS wasn't designed for it. It was built for servers, not skulls. It cannot express whether damage is reversible to neural tissue or whether the patient can even detect the violation. So I designed NISS (Neural Impact Scoring System) specifically for neural harm. Maybe one day we can extend CVSS into NISS for the neural domain as BCIs are likely only going to be more widely adopted. We're merely at the cusp of it all, and this is that initial step towards a safer, more secure future, together.

What I discovered surprised me: **77 of those 102 attack techniques have direct therapeutic counterparts.** The same neural mechanism that can disrupt cognition can also treat a neurological condition. The same stimulation pattern that causes involuntary motor activation in an attack is used therapeutically for Parkinson's disease. It seems like common sense now, but that wasn't my initial intent. If BCI security research proves that signal injection ([QIF-T0001](https://qinnovate.com/TARA/QIF-T0001/), based on Kohno et al. 2009 and Bonaci et al. 2015) can occur at the brain, why can't we inject it with intentional payloads to restore things like vision? Science may not be there yet, but that's the point of a framework: to help anchor us to science and what is probable with what we can do. There's still so much more I have yet to unpack, and it's only more exciting with each day. So much so that it's nearly 5 AM and I don't want to sleep... again. This dual-use reality means BCI security cannot be separated from clinical ethics. They are the same problem viewed from different angles.

60 techniques map to specific DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses through documented neural pathways. Every single technique implicates at least one neuroright: cognitive liberty, mental privacy, psychological continuity, mental integrity, or cognitive authenticity.

The importance of having an open framework is that just in the past month, I was able to map out more and more simply by using what I could find and what my AI agents (predominantly Claude) could help me digest from academia. It may not be 100% accurate, and that's exactly why I need more peer review of this work: to ensure we have something that is fundamental to not just our safety, but also our health. This is why neuroethics needs more engineers, to help tackle these problems from a different lens.

The mapping process itself keeps uncovering gaps, not just in attacks, but in the ethical frameworks meant to protect against them. When I scored all 102 techniques against the four established neurorights proposed by Ienca and Andorno, one genuine gap emerged: no framework distinguishes *reading* neural data from *writing* into neural signals. Mental Privacy covers confidentiality: don't read my brain without consent. But what about injecting false signals? That's a different class of violation, and it needed its own right: **Cognitive Authenticity**. QIF also extends Mental Integrity with engineering-level signal dynamics protections and Mental Privacy with data-lifecycle protections. The framework doesn't just catalogue what's known; it exposes what's missing.

## Situating the Work

I'll be honest: I'm new to neurorights. I discovered the field while researching with Claude, trying to answer my own questions about cognitive authenticity and cognitive sovereignty. What I kept running into were names like Marcello Ienca and Roberto Andorno, who proposed four foundational neurorights: cognitive liberty, mental privacy, mental integrity, and psychological continuity. Then Rafael Yuste and the NeuroRights Foundation, who helped Chile amend their constitution to protect neurorights in 2021. Then UNESCO's 2025 Recommendation on the Ethics of Neurotechnology.

Reading their work felt like finding the philosophical language for what I'd been trying to build from the engineering side. I don't know enough yet. I need more formal education on it, and a lot more thinking. But I know this much: my privacy is my mind. And I need the frameworks of neuroethics and neurorights to understand how QIF can be implemented ethically, to ensure that BCIs, when they move past clinical use, are safe, accessible, and here for the betterment of people. Not for some *Altered Carbon* scenario. That's scary, especially as a Buddhist. Imagine that. I'd rather reincarnate as a dog if that's the case, or an alien... I don't get to pick though, that's not how this works.

## What the Framework Cannot Answer

Every framework has limits. I'm trying to find where they reside. I'm apparently good at testing limits. QIF can trace how a specific vulnerability violates a specific neuroright through a documented neural pathway. But there are harder questions it can't touch: questions about justice, access, bias, free will. Those aren't engineering problems. Those are philosophy problems, policy problems, human problems. And I need to study them properly.

That's why this work is open source. When the framework, the threat data, and the scoring are freely available, the community that forms around them will ask the questions I haven't thought of yet. As I pursue a master's in Neuroethics and Bioethics, I expect many of those questions to surface, questions that will help me build on the foundations I've been laying. The framework is a starting point, not a finish line.

## Approach

Everything is open: open publication, transparent methodology, publicly available framework documents, equations, and reference implementations. Neural security research must be developed in the open, not behind closed doors. The people whose brains will be connected deserve to understand exactly how they're protected.

## How AI Was Used

My goal with AI (predominantly Claude, alongside Gemini and ChatGPT) was to help lay my ideas out as they evolved. I could dissect the sections that needed further development while AI agents helped validate the research and tie together the pieces I mapped out. The architecture, the scoring, the clinical mappings, the cross-domain connections: those are mine. AI helped me get the work out of my head and into a form that others can evaluate.

But AI cannot replace what comes next. I need real humans: academics, clinicians, neuroscientists, and like-minded intellectuals who share a vision for a future without the anxiety and baggage that comes with today's digital landscape. The [Transparency Statement](governance/TRANSPARENCY.md) documents every AI interaction, with GPG-signed monthly checksums for verification. The [Derivation Log](qif-framework/QIF-DERIVATION-LOG.md) traces 57 entries of human decision-making (every architectural choice, every pivot, every dead end) so that any reviewer can follow the same reasoning chain and challenge it with better reasoning.

There is still so much for me to answer. I hope to share my learnings with the world as I continue working on this project through school, and I believe we'll be hearing from more and more humans in the loop (HITL).

## The Questions Ahead

I do not want to answer what consciousness is. I'm not sure anyone can, and I think that's the point. What I do know is that we are already brain-computer interfaces in a meaningful sense. The average person checks their phone over 100 times a day. We offload memory to search engines, navigation to GPS, social reasoning to feeds curated by algorithms we don't control. The boundary between mind and machine blurred long before anyone implanted an electrode.

BCIs just make that boundary physical. And that changes the stakes entirely. Consider: a brain-computer interface that restores sight to the blind is something every person on earth would hope exists. The therapeutic potential is extraordinary. But the same interface that restores vision can, in principle, inject false visual percepts. The same device that treats Parkinson's can induce involuntary movement. The dual-use problem isn't hypothetical. It's inherent to the physics.

A disclaimer: the Neural Atlas is not meant — and shall never be meant — to answer what consciousness is. That question is above all of our paygrade. What the framework *does* address is the engineering reality: the technologies we're building will interact with a system whose full capabilities we haven't mapped yet. The pace of scientific discovery is accelerating — boundaries we assumed were settled are dissolving — and a security framework for neural interfaces needs to be designed with that humility built in.

What helps me sleep is studying. Pursuing bioethics and neuroethics alongside this technical work, surrounded by diverse academic perspectives, is how I plan to earn the right to ask better questions. Not alone, but in dialogue with clinicians, philosophers, neuroscientists, and engineers who see the same urgency.

The goal of Qinnovate is not to provide final answers. It's to start the right questions — and hopefully inspire another generation of thinkers to help answer the ones that will emerge as we learn more about the mysteries of the mind. The key is doing this thoughtfully: advancing without recklessness, questioning without paralysis. Being aware of the [Wegner-Schneider effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_process_theory) — the psychological finding that trying to suppress a thought only makes it more persistent — reminds me that ignoring these risks doesn't make them disappear. The only path forward is through: studying them openly, building safeguards deliberately, and trusting that transparency invites better thinking than secrecy ever could.

## Vision

Normal users of the internet shouldn't have to worry about visiting a website and accidentally having a man-in-the-middle deliver ransomware to their computer. That should be left to the professionals, and yet the tools we built to create what we call the modern internet are still relics of an era that didn't anticipate the threats we face today. The future state has so much room for improvement.

Brain-computer interfaces represent a fresh slate. It's not often that society arrives at a truly pivotal moment in technology — a chance to build something right from the beginning, rather than retrofitting security onto a system that was never designed for it. To me, BCIs are that digital leap: a chance to ensure that the next generation of human-computer interaction is secure by design, not by afterthought. And ensuring we still remain the definition of human at our core. That's where neuroethics comes in.

I'm glad the days of browser pop-ups are no longer a major concern. But the next frontier is adversaries looking to fingerprint our actual thoughts. The future I envision is one that is achievable, and this is the work that gets us there, collectively.

## Collaborate

This is a conversation I cannot have alone. I'm looking for academics, researchers, and neuroscientists to refine QIF and establish ethical guidelines for where technology should and shouldn't intervene, for medical and safety reasons. There are unknowns in neuroscience today, and that frontier is being challenged every day. The gaps are the research agenda.

If you work with electrodes, patient data, BCI signal processing, neuroethics, or security architecture, I'd like to hear from you.
