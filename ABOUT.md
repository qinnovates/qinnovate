# About the Founder

I'm Kevin Qi, an independent security researcher with 15+ years across biotech, high-scale consumer tech, publishing, and institutional finance. I specialize in stepping into void environments — places where data exists at astronomical scale, but the systems to interpret and secure it don't.

Part of how I think is understanding how things break so I can make them better. That means learning how to identify attacks before they occur. The best security architects probe their own systems the way an adversary would, so they can defend them the way an engineer should. That convergence is what I bring to neurosecurity.

## Why This Exists

My work ethic comes from watching my father, an autodidactic electrical engineer from China, navigate a world that spoke a different tongue. Despite deep technical knowledge, he had no formal education and immigrated here starting as a dishwasher to help pay for his father's woodworking factory, which eventually burned to the ground. That fire nearly cost our family the ancestral home: a single roof in a small fishing village that sheltered three generations at once. Watching him engineer a life for us out of nothing taught me what grit truly is.

To me, engineering isn't just a career. It's a survival mechanism — turning uncertainty into something measurable and actionable.

## The Insight

A few years ago I was diagnosed with severe B12 deficiency. Not the kind where you feel tired and take a supplement. The kind that damages your nerves. Coordination deteriorated. Cognition slowed. Words disappeared mid-sentence. Worst of all, my sense of identity shifted. One deficiency. One molecule. And the entire operating system of who I was began to drift.

That experience left me with a question I couldn't shake: how does the absence of one molecule alter coordination, cognition, and personality? B12 is essential for myelin synthesis, the insulation around your nerves. Without it, signals degrade. The wiring frays. You feel it everywhere.

That's the insight that became QIF. Not from a textbook. From losing function and fighting to get it back. The coherence metric at the center of the framework — the idea that signal integrity degrades measurably across layers — started as lived experience before it became math.

If a vitamin deficiency can rewire a person, imagine what a compromised BCI could do. That's not a hypothetical for me. That's the reason I don't sleep until the protocol is right.

## The Precedent

In the 1970s, computer networks were fragmented — every manufacturer had its own proprietary system, and none of them could talk to each other. Charles Bachman provided the architectural vision that broke the deadlock: 7 layers, flexible enough to encompass every competing approach. That became the OSI model — the foundation the entire internet is built on.

They didn't wait until networking was "figured out." They built the framework while the technology was still evolving, and it shaped everything that followed. QIF follows the same principle.

## The Discovery

In Istanbul, I met Ali, an Airbnb host who was like a sagacious captain straight out of *Moby Dick* — the kind of man who had traveled the world and carried its stories in his eyes. When he mentioned one of the oldest bookstores in the city and saw the spark in my eyes, he didn't just point me there. He came with me. And when I lost myself in the stacks — pulling atlases, flipping through century-old pages — he waited. Two hours. Or maybe it was three. No rush, no judgment. Just presence.

Inside, I discovered a copy of *The Development of the Periodic Law*, published in 1896 by F.P. Venable, Ph.D. It documented how the periodic table went through dozens of visual representations — circles, spirals, waves, towers — before arriving at the rectangular grid even children explore today. Mendeleev didn't just organize what was known — he left gaps for what wasn't. Those gaps predicted elements that were later discovered.

I carried an entire stack of books through Istanbul, to Morocco, and back home — guarding them like treasures. That journey fueled something in me: a hunger for yesterday to act as the foundation for tomorrow.

Like the OSI model and the periodic table, QIF is a living framework: organizing what we know, highlighting what we don't, evolving as discovery fills in the gaps.

## The Framework

**Qinnovate** is the standards body — where forward thinking begins. **QIF** (Quantum Indeterministic Framework for Neural Security) is the flagship research: security engineering grounded in neuroethics, developing rigorous, testable frameworks that protect cognitive fingerprints as we enter the age of brain-computer interfaces. The "Quantum" is literal — neural signals exhibit quantum-scale indeterminacy at the synaptic level, and that irreducible unpredictability is what makes each person's cognitive signature fundamentally uncloneable. QIF builds security architecture on that physical foundation.

Our minds deserve the same security architecture we've built for our networks. QIF is that architecture.

The framework now includes [9 governance documents](governance/) mapping technical controls to neuroethics principles, the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Neurotechnology (2025), and regulatory requirements across US federal, state, and international jurisdictions.

A mentor once taught me: we don't give answers to other people's ponders. We give guidance. A framework. One that is simple yet answers itself as time moves on. One that works with or without us.

That is the goal of Qinnovate.

## Collaborate

This is a conversation I cannot have alone. I'm looking for academics, researchers, and neuroscientists to refine QIF and establish ethical guidelines for where technology should and shouldn't intervene, for medical and safety reasons. There are unknowns in neuroscience today, and that frontier is being challenged every day. The gaps are the research agenda.

If you work with electrodes, patient data, BCI signal processing, neuroethics, or security architecture, I'd like to hear from you.
