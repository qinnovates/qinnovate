# About — Kevin Qi

I'm **Kevin Qi**, a security engineer and ethical neurosecurity researcher. I started this project with a question: *what happens to a patient when their brain-computer interface gets hacked?*

Not what happens to the data. Not what happens to the device. What happens to the *mind*. I couldn't find a framework that answered that, so I built one. This is the OSI of Mind.

That question didn't come from a textbook. A B12 deficiency damaged my nervous system. I couldn't walk for months. My hands were uncontrollable. I didn't feel like myself. Once you've felt your own nervous system seize up on you, the idea of plugging a machine into that system hits different.

## Why Neuroethics

Cybersecurity is about understanding human behavior and building guardrails: confidentiality, integrity, availability. When you extend that to the brain, "availability" means a patient's ability to think, "integrity" means the authenticity of their own thoughts, and "confidentiality" means the privacy of their inner experience. You're doing neuroethics whether you call it that or not.

The future of BCIs needs ethical neurosecurity researchers to find vulnerabilities before attackers do. The same way we need ethical hackers in security today.

## What I Found

I catalogued every known BCI attack technique I could find: 60 at first, merged from three inventories. Then I asked: *what do computers and neurons actually have in common?* The answer was physics. Signals operating at different scales, from electromagnetic fields up through cortical oscillations. That became QIF's layered architecture.

When I mapped those techniques across the frequency bands, gaps appeared everywhere. The catalogue grew to 103. I traced each technique through neural pathways, cognitive functions, and psychiatric outcomes. CVSS wasn't built for this. It can't express whether damage is reversible or whether the patient can detect the violation. So I designed NISS for neural harm.

**77 of those 103 techniques have direct therapeutic counterparts.** The same stimulation that causes involuntary motor activation in an attack treats Parkinson's therapeutically. If signal injection can occur at the brain, why can't we inject intentional payloads to restore vision? The dual-use reality means BCI security cannot be separated from clinical ethics. They are the same problem from different angles.

## The Hourglass

The framework is an 11-band, 3-zone architecture with the Neural Interface (I0) at its waist. Biology above. Silicon below. The [TARA Atlas](https://qinnovate.com/TARA/) maps 103 techniques across this hierarchy, each scored and traced to clinical outcomes through the Neural Impact Chain.

I was inspired by Francis Preston Venable's *The Development of the Periodic Law* (1896), found in a bookstore in Istanbul. It documented how the periodic table went through dozens of visual representations before arriving at the grid we know today. Mendeleev didn't just organize what was known. He left gaps for what wasn't. Those gaps predicted elements that were later discovered. QIF follows the same principle: organizing what we know, highlighting what we don't, evolving as discovery fills the gaps.

## How AI Was Used

AI (predominantly Claude, alongside Gemini and ChatGPT) helped me lay out ideas, validate research, and tie together pieces I mapped out. The architecture, scoring, clinical mappings, and cross-domain connections are mine. AI helped get the work out of my head and into a form others can evaluate.

The [Transparency Statement](governance/TRANSPARENCY.md) documents every AI interaction. The [Derivation Log](qif-framework/QIF-DERIVATION-LOG.md) traces 67 entries of human decision-making so any reviewer can follow the reasoning and challenge it.

## What the Framework Cannot Answer

QIF can trace how a vulnerability violates a neuroright through a documented neural pathway. But there are harder questions it can't touch: justice, access, bias, free will. Those aren't engineering problems. That's why I'm pursuing a master's in Neuroethics and Bioethics alongside this technical work.

The goal is not to provide final answers. It's to start the right questions and build a foundation that others can test, validate, or refute.

## Collaborate

This is a conversation I cannot have alone. I'm looking for academics, researchers, neuroscientists, and engineers to refine QIF and establish ethical guidelines for where technology should and shouldn't go. The gaps are the research agenda.
